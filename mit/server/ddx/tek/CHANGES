This directory is new for R4.  It provides support for the Tektronix 4319
workstation using the MIT cfb driver.  The files were donated by Tektronix
and integrated here at MIT; thus they have only been tested on our 4319;
simple changes may be necessary to get them running on other Tek
workstations (some XD88 code is evident in various places, but it is almost
certainly broken).
