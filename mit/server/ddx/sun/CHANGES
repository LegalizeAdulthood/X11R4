The following changes have been made to this directory since R3:

     o  Support for SPARCstation1, both CG3 and CG6.

     o  Should work on Sun 3/80 as well (even with CG6), but
     	we were unable to test this configuration.

     o	Support for SunOS 4.0.x.

     o  Now uses mi software cursors

     o  Keyboard mapping update, should match xnews now.
