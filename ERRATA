			     R4 Errata


1.  You are building servers on 680x0 or VAX platforms, you should probably
    use GCC if you have it, especially for the server.  However, please note
    that the system has only been tested with gcc version 1.35.  It is known
    that the XtNewString macro in Xt miscompiles under gcc 1.36.  It is also
    known that some parts of the system miscompile under gcc 1.36 on the SPARC.
    Make sure you have run "fixincludes" from the gcc distribution before you
    build the system, or ioctl() calls will miscompile.  If you have installed
    your gcc-include files somewhere besides /usr/local/lib/gcc-include, you
    will have to edit line 197 of the file mit/util/makedepend/main.c to
    point at the proper directory.


2.  If you are trying to install library files into a directory other than
    /usr/lib/X11, you'll need to change XFILESEARCHPATHDEFAULT and ERRORDB
    in the file mit/lib/Xt/IntrinsicI.h to point at the correct directories.
    You'll also need to change SYSTEM_INIT_FILE in mit/clients/twm/parse.c.
    You'll also need to add the following line to mit/lib/Xmu/Imakefile:

	DEFINES = -DBITMAPDIR=\"$(INCDIR)/bitmaps\"


3.  Do not turn on InstallXdmConfig as there is no longer a default directory
    under mit/clients/xdm/config/.  Install xdm configuration files by hand.


4.  Some versions of tcsh erroneously set the eighth bit on characters they 
    emit.  If you are not seeing text in your xterm windows and are using 
    tcsh, try using a different shell (e.g. xterm -e /bin/sh).


5.  Sites running BSD 4.3 on vaxes will need to enable the qvss and/or qdss
    servers and will need to specify -DX11R4 in the ServerDefines line in
    mit/config/bsd.cf if building the qdss server:

	#ifdef VaxArchitecture
	#define XqvssServer Xqvss
	#define XqdssServer Xqdss
	#define ServerDefines StandardDefines ExtensionDefines -DXDMCP -DNOSTDHDRS -DX11R4
	#endif


6.  If you are building on a macII without gcc, you need to define CcCmd in 
    mit/config/macII.cf as follows:

	#define CcCmd	cc -B /usr/lib/big/

7.  If you are building on a vax, the lucida typewriter fonts will not
    display correctly.  To correct this, change line 410 of the file
    mit/fonts/bdftosnf/fontutil.c from:

	inwidth = GLWIDTHBYTESPADDED (pCI->metrics.characterWidth, glyphPad);

    to:

	inwidth = GLWIDTHBYTESPADDED (pCI->metrics.rightSideBearing -
				      pCI->metrics.leftSideBearing, glyphPad);


8.  If you are building with shared libraries on a Sun (we suggest that you
    do), remember that you need to run "ldconfig" as root after installing
    the shared libraries.  While building and installing the distribution,
    you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing X shared
    libraries you might have (e.g. those distributed with OpenWindows).  You
    should make sure you do not have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment
    during the build or the installation.  If you are going to keep xterm and
    xload as setuid programs, please note that the shared libraries must be
    installed in /usr/lib, /usr/5lib, or /usr/local/lib for these programs to
    work (or else those programs must be linked statically).


9.  The IBM server does run on the RT under AIX.  It should work under AOS
    on the RT, and under AIX on the PS/2.


10. Make sure your own resource files don't try to specify xterm geometry with
	xterm*geometry: <...>
    This will cause menu geometries to be incorrect.  Instead, use one of:
	xterm.geometry: <...>
	xterm*VT100.geometry: <...>
    The same problem may exist with other clients.


11. Various R3 clients will get protocol errors when run against an R4 server.
    If you need to run these clients without fixing them, try "xset bc".


12.  When the "utmpInhibit" resource is turned on, xterm exits with no error
     message.  To fix, change lines 1784 and 1785 of mit/clients/xterm/main.c
     to:
	if ((pw = getpwuid(screen->uid)) &&
	    !resource.utmpInhibit &&
     Also change line 1855 to read:
	if (geteuid() == 0 && pw)


13.  If you are building the server on an old SunOS (e.g. 3.5), you will have
     to add the following defines to mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c to get it
     to compile:

	#define CG3AC_MONOLEN (128*1024)
	#define CG3AC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN
	#define CG3BC_MONOLEN CG3AC_MONOLEN
	#define CG3BC_ENBLEN  CG3AC_MONOLEN


14.  The twm feature to use window borders to highlight the active window is
     broken.  The fix is to replace lines 2468-2471 of 
     mit/clients/twm/menus.c with the following:

	if (onoroff) {
	    XSetWindowBorder (dpy, tmp->frame, tmp->border);
	    if (tmp->title_w)
	      XSetWindowBorder (dpy, tmp->title_w, tmp->border);
	} else {
	    XSetWindowBorderPixmap (dpy, tmp->frame, tmp->gray);
	    if (tmp->title_w)
	      XSetWindowBorderPixmap (dpy, tmp->title_w, tmp->gray);
	}


15.  The AsciiDiskSource compatibility has bugs that may cause contributed
     clients to fail.  Change the expression "TWO" to "ONE" on line 1309 of 
     mit/lib/Xaw/AsciiSrc.c, and move the call to XtMergeArgLists from 
     line 1302 to line 1307 (just before the call to XtCreateWidget).

16.  A SunOS 4.0.3 include file (/usr/include/sundev/vuid_event.h) does not
     compile under GCC because it breaks an ANSI C rule.  Replace line 42
     of that file with the following:

        have to be concerned.  In fact, the vuid interface doesn''t
