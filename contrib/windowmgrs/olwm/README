Olwm (OpenLook window manager) is an ICCCM compliant window manager
supplied for use with the XView toolkit.  It requires the graphics
library, olgx, in the contrib/lib/olgx section to build.  Olwm is also
dependent upon the OpenLook fonts found in the contrib/toolkits/XView/fonts
directory.  By default, these fonts are already included in the FCS
X Version 11 Release 4 distribution.  You will only need these fonts if
you are using an older version of the server.

The Imakefile will need to be modified to correctly reflect the location 
of the olgx library and include files.  Please see the Imakefile for details.
The default behavior is to build olwm as if all sources were in the contrib
directory of the X Version 11 Release 4 distribution.

A man page for olwm, olwm.man, can be found in this directory.
