				GWM KNOWN BUGS:
				###############

This is the list of bugs that we are aware of in the current release.
We are working to fix them...

				###############

the new mwm-like resize style is not fully operational yet, we are working
on it

geometry-change does not work... yet

Many built-in functions still do not check the type of their arguments,
causing possible bus errors when handled the wrong type of arguments.
We try to catch some bus errors, though...

"exit" to a tag outside of a file being loaded do impredictable results

The standard profile is not "polished" yet -- all contributions are welcome

The debugging functions are very crude.

We need to add new functions, you cannnot emulate fully all window managers
with the ones provided in this release...
