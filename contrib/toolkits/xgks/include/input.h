/*
 * Each workstation structure contains a list of input devices that have been
 * accessed by the application.  These devices may be active or inactive.
 * Each logical input device is represented by a structure that completely
 * defines the initial state, current state of that device, and implementation
 * details of that device.  When a physical device is triggered, this list
 * is search for active logical devices that must be triggered.  The echo area
 * and current location of the physical device determine if the logical device
 * is triggered.  Each triggered input device updates its value and prompt.
 * When a logical device that is operating in EVENT mode is triggered, it
 * creates an event record and places that record in the GKS state event queue.
