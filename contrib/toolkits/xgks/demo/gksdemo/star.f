C      DESCRIPTION:
C       This program draws a yellow star on a blue background and writes
C       the title 'Star' in green in under the star.
C      CONFORMANCE:
C       GKS level: ma
C       FORTRAN-77 binding with FORTRAN-77 Subset comments.
C       At least one output or outin workstation.
C
C      Define GKS constants.
C
       INTEGER GSOLID
       PARAMETER ( GSOLID = 1 )
       INTEGER GACENT,GAHALF
       PARAMETER ( GACENT = 2, GAHALF = 3 )
C
C      Implementation dependent constants.
C
       INTEGER ERROUT,TTOUT,WSTYPE,NBYTES
       PARAMETER ( ERROUT = 1, TTOUT = 5, WSTYPE = 0, NBYTES = -1 )
C
C      Define coordinates for drawing the star.
C   
       REAL STARX( 5 ),STARY( 5 )
       DATA STARX / 0.951057, -0.951057, 0.587785, 0.0, -0.587785 /
       DATA STARY / 0.309017, 0.309017, -0.951057, 1.0, -0.951057 /
C
C      Perform implementation dependent initialization
C
       OPEN ( TTOUT,STATUS='NEW' )
C      Open GKS and activate a workstation.
C
       CALL GOPKS ( ERROUT,NBYTES )
       CALL GOPWK ( 1,TTOUT,WSTYPE )
       CALL GACWK ( 1 )

       CALL GSCR ( 1,1,1.0,1.0,0.0 )
       CALL GSCR ( 1,2,1.0,1.0,1.0 )
C
C      Fill the star with solid yellow.
C
       CALL GSFAIS ( GSOLID )
       CALL GSFACI ( 1 )
C

C
       CALL GSCHH ( 0.15 )
       CALL GSTXAL ( GACENT,GAHALF )
       CALL GSTXCI ( 2 )
C
C      Draw the title.
C
       CALL GTX ( 0.0,-1.1,'Star' )
C
C      FORTRAN 77 subset version.
C      CALL GTXS ( 0.0,-1.1,4,'Star' )
C
