Before you can run sled, you need the following files:
	sled
	palette_clrs
	text_bndl_tbl
	char_hts_n_wds
	menu


To run SLED just type: sled <workstation name>

/* sled e 9460 */

/* (make sure to start up the workstation server r9460_ddgks first.
If you plan to create a pic file, you must also start up
dipic_ddgks FROM THE DIRECTORY YOU WILL BE RUNNING SLED FROM) */

For more information on sled, see the users' manual
or my thesis in MS/manual and MS/thesis, respectively.

To compile sled:

1) check out everything in RCS directory (i.e. co RCS/*)

2) execute makefile (i.e. make).
