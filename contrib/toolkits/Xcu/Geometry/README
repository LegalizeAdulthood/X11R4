There is a bug in the X11R3 Inrinsics routine XtMakeGeometryRequest(),
which is found in Geometry.c.  The effect of this bug is to make
my geometry managers look bad. :-)

To duplicate on your system, try the "xtbl 6 -file tst6" demonstration
found in examples/xtbl.  After hitting the "fill" button, you will see
some widgets out of place.  For another demonstration of this effect,
after the widgets appear, resize the window
much larger with your window manager.  Then when you change the text in one
of the widgets by clicking in the text box, the window will get small
again, but some of the children will be in the wrong place.

In this directory is a fixed version of Geometry.c.  Just in case you have
a copy of Geometry.c that has been modified since it came off the original
X11R3 distribution, "gdiff" contains the difference between the original
Geometry.c and the one with my correction.

I assume that X11R4 will have this patch included.
