Welcome to the Xcu widgets directory of X11R4.  (Xcu Version 1.4)

If you are new to Xcu widgets, you are probably asking yourself,
"Is there any good stuff in here?"  Well, I'll give you a quick
rundown on how to find the answer to that question.  In the
Readme.dir directory there are a bunch more README's.

    widgets    : a quick summary of the Xcu widgets
    tbl        : a more detailed description of the tbl widget
    changes123 : changes from earlier versions to V1.3
    changes4   : changes from V1.3 to V1.4
    make       : how to make this distribution
    examples   : a roadmap to the examples
    bugs       : how to get prompt attention if you find bugs

Briefly, there is at least one widget you should look at, XcuTbl.
It is a geometry manager that lays out widgets using the formats of the troff
preprocessor, "tbl".

If you're looking for something more exciting, check out the XcuWlm widget,
which is a very useful alternative to DEC's UIL.  It can do a widget layout
for you given an ascii description, and that's just for starters...

Potscript versions of the documentation are available via anonymous FTP
from 128.84.247.85 : pub/xcu.v1.4.ps.Z.

As a final piece of bait, I am working on converting a bunch of applications
that will let you make lots of pretty pictures, but only if you take the
time to install Xcu!  (Cellular automata, fractals, henon mappings...)
