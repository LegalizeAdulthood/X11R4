			 "101" Ways to Use Wlm
			To Set Client Variables

This directory contains a series of example programs that illustrate 
how to use the Wlm public functions in a client program.

The examples are not automatically made during the grand make, because
you may not want all these client programs sitting around gobbling up
your disk space.  They can each be made explicitly (ex1, ex2, ex3, and ex4).

Each example consists of a header and a trailer include file and
the particular code being illustrated.

ex1.c / ex1.wl : How to register a callback function to set client values.
ex2.c / ex2.wl : How to set a client variable to a client-specific value.
ex3.c / ex3.wl : How to set a client variable to a widget-specific value.

Each of these examples operates on the client variable "x", initializing
it to zero, and then setting it to 1 or 2, depending on the widget which
is clicked.  Which method is better "depends".  I use all three methods,
depending on the circumstances.

ex4.c / ex4.wl : How to set a client variable to a widget-specific value,
		 The difference here is that x is assumed to be unitialized
		 by the client, and the client finds x's initial value by
		 sampling Wlm.

Default for Xcu widgets is picture frames instead of shadows.  If you prefer
shadows, edit the file "defaults.wl" so that the shadow line is
"True" instead of "False".

Each example is run as follows: "exN exN", where N is 1, 2, 3, or 4.
