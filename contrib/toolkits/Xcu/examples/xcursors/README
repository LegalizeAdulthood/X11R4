This directory shows how an "interesting" use of the widget layout
description language makes possible a utility without writing a client,
but instead just making use of the "xlayout" program in the adjoining
directory.

A list of X cursors was obtained in "cursor_list".
A shell script was written that converted "cursor_list" to a fragment
included in "cursors.wl".
Then, "cursors.wl" was compiled with wlc.

The command "xlayout cursors" produces a table of cursors as one
moves the pointer into each widget. ("bwcursors" uses shadows instead
of facets)
