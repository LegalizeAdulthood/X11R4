xlayout is a simple client that allows a widget description language
programmer to test a layout.

xlayout.wh contains all the Xcu widgets, so xlayout.c will not need
recompiling until widgets from other sources are included in a
description language file.

To test a layout, merely issue the following two commands, where name
is the name of the layout description file with a .wl extension:

	../../wlmCompiler/wlc name
	xlayout name

The following sample layout descriptions are included in this directory:

	(bw_)bmgr   : shows the five CuBmgr (button manager) semantics
	(bw_)menu   : shows a common menu device using the CuDeck widget
	(bw_)shadow : shows facets vs. shadow and sensitive vs. insensitive
	(bw_)manip  : shows a graphics manipulation menu

	The bw_ versions work better for displays without good colors

IMPORTANT HINT:  You will want a customized version of this program
on your system when you get around to writing layout descriptions.
(To customize, all you have to do is put the widgets you will use
in xlayout.wh)  Then, to test menus all you need is xlayout, wlc, and an
editor.  Repeat the following three steps until satisfied:

    1) vi layout.wl
    2) wlc layout
    3) xlayout layout

No application code, hence no compiling, no linking.  The only thing
you can't test are things like callbacks to your application.  It is 
literally possible to do one iteration of the above in under 15 seconds.
I've made lots of minor adjustments to menus in just that fashion.
