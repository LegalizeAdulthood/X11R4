This demo is similar to that of "xcursors".

By executing "xlayout normal", one can see all the English legible fonts
in a single layout. ("English legible" means that by using the font name as
the label, the label spells out the font name in English.)

CAUTION: It takes a LONG time for the server to load all the fonts, so there
will be a noticeable delay...  allow several minutes!

By executing "xlayout weird", one can see all the fonts that are not English
legible. No offense intended for other languages :-)
