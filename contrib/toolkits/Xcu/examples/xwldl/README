The trivial examples in this directory illustrate the important aspects
of the Widget Layout Description Language, WLDL.

Each file, ex1.wl, ex2.wl, ex3.wl, and ex4.wl, has instructive comments.

Ex2.wl is formed by adding a few lines to ex1.wl, etc.

To see the results, merely run the compiled versions through the provided
"xlayout" previewer, as follows (interrupt to exit):

	xlayout ex1
	xlayout ex2
	xlayout ex3
	xlayout ex4

If you prefer shadows to picture frames, edit the file "default_resources",
so that the shadow resource is "True" instead of "False", then recompile
each example.  (Recompile as in the lines above, replacing "xlayout" by "wlc".)

The four elements of the WLDL are:

	1) Widget Hierarchy
	2) Resource Specification
	3) Default Resource Specification
	4) Directives

Widget Hierarchy and Resource specification are introduced in ex1.
Default Resource specification is introduced in ex2.
(Ex3 is a transition example containing a couple more widgets.)
Directives are introduced in ex4.
