This directory contains a "Good-bye, World" example of using the
widget layout manager.  The file "world.wl" contains a near minimal
example of a layout description, and world.c is a minimal client
to execute a program using that description.  Note that world.c
contains the "make_tag_class_list()" function explicitly.  It can be
generated automatically as shown in the xmake example.

Clicking the mouse in the widget will cause a callback that terminates the
program.  To make and execute :

	make world
	world world
