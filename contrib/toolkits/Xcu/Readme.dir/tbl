CuTbl is a geometry manager that lays out a fixed number of widgets
according to a specification patterned after the "tbl" preprocessor
for creating tables in documents.  Thus, to get a bunch of widgets
to look like this:

                     --------------------- ----------
                    |                     |          |
                    |                     |          |
                    |                     |          |
                    |---------- ----------|          |
                    |          |          |          |
                    |          |          |          |
                    |          |          |          |
                     ---------- ---------- ----------

The "tbl" input specification would look like this:

                                   c s c
                                   c c ^.

This is just a very simple example.  Actually, the widget is loaded up
with lots of bells and whistles, such as the ability to specify
equal sized columns and/or rows, left, right, or center justify the strings
of the children widgets when they contain newlines (assuming the children can
handle such a request, which the accompanying label widget, "XcuLabel", does),
and certain widgets can be marked to "take up the slack" when adjusting the
children to fit into the layout. The widget resizes elegantly (it allows
resize requests from the children), looking at resources to determine whether
the widgets, the internal padding, or the inter-child padding (or any
combination of the three) adjust to fit the layout into the new size.

Since an "m by n" layout array of widgets is a simple subset of this widget's
capabilities, I have made it easy to subclass a widget that accepts a different
input specification and merely transforms it into a tbl specification.  For
example, the derived widget "XcuRc" transforms "2 x 2" into "c c\nc c.".

XcuRc is a geometry manager subclassed from XcuTbl.  It is a trivial example
of a XcuTbl subclass and is not meant to do anything very useful.

Warning: XcuTbl will often produce funny results because of a bug in the
XtMakeGeometryRequest() routine in the X11R3 intrinsics file Geometry.c.
A fix can be found in the "Geometry" subdirectory of this distribution.
