If you encounter bugs, please mail me a bug-report on one of the X bug
report forms.  Make sure you mail it to me, not to MIT!

Not only bugs, of course, but any suggestions you might have for
new features, better documentation, error messages, etc., would
be greatly appreciated.

I will keep a file of known bugs and their status on my home machine,
and it will be available by anonymous ftp from "128.84.247.85".
The file is xcu.v1.4.bugs.

If you send me your mailing address, I will send you bug reports,
requests for comments on new features, etc.

The primary deficiency with Xcu right now is that the widget layout
description language used by the XcuWlm widget does not yet support
popup widgets, which undoubtedly need to be treated differently from
other widgets.
