	This directory contains files that make up the HP Widget manual
	for X11.

	The basic manual files are in this directory and the manpages
	are included in the "manpages" subdirectory.  All of these files
	are ready for printing using any line printer.

	To print any file, use the command:

		lp <filename>

[The PostScript versions of these have been tared and compressed as ps.tar.Z.
 To extract, type:

	zcat ps.tar.Z | tar xvf -

 and then print the files in ps/* and ps/man3/* as normal.]
