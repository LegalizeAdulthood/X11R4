    This directory contains the Xw widgets used in Doug Young's book "X Window
    System: Programming and Applications".  They were originally provided by
    Hewlett-Packard Company as unsupported, user-contributed code.  The version
    in this release was ported to the MIT R3 Xt Intrinsics by:

	Martin Friedmann, CITI, University of Michigan
	martin@citi.umich.edu

	John Carlson, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories
	carlson@tis.llnl.gov


    and was contributed by Friedmann and:

	Mark Moraes, University of Toronto
	moraes@csri.toronto.edu


    This code is not supported by HP and any bugs should be reported to the
    individuals listed above.

    ---------------------------  Status  -------------------------------


    1.  Chapter 7 of "Programming with the HP X Widgets" discusses how to
        write a widget.  The code listings that appear in this chapter,
        along with a simple demo program are located in the MButton 
	directory.

    2.  Applications using the titlebar widget should not issue a SetValues
        to the static text widget created by the titlebar.  If this is
        necessary, the application should create its own static text widget
        as a child of the titlebar and set the constraints as is appropriate.

    3.  The panel widget can occasionally clip its workspace if the
        application destroys and then recreates its pulldown menu.  Resizing
        the application window through the window manager causes the widgets
        to redisplay properly.

    4.  There are several problems in the text edit man page. On page 4,
        the constants XttextRead, XttextEdit and  XttextAppend should be
        XwtextRead, XwtextEdit and XwtextAppend. On the same page, the
        default value for the DiskSrc XtNeditType resource should be
        XwtextRead, not XwtextEdit.

    5.  There is an additional resource in the scrolled window widget: 
        XtNborderPad. This is an integer which defines the number of pixels 
        between the scrollbars and the viewable area of the scrolled window.  
        The default padding is 4 pixels.
