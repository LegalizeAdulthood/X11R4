Note:  For those who have been using the 1.0 version of the XView library,
there was a document that summerized the XView API (Application Programmer's
Interface).  This work has been incoorporated into the "XView Programming
Manual" by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.  The previously distributed
version of the API summery is now out of date.
