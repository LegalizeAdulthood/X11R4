In the XView.config file, the help files are put into $(LIBRARY_DEST)/help.
To install these files, run imake to create the Makefile, then do 
make install.

To get help for an XView application, have the end users set the environment 
varaible HELP_DIR to point to this location.

All XView help files end in ".info".  They are found in the directory
specified by the environment variable HELP_DIR.  Briefly, when the Help 
key is depressed, an ACTION_HELP event is sent to the window under the pointer.
The XView object underneath the pointer is determined, and its XV_HELP_DATA 
string is used to identify the .info file and keyword.  The string has the 
format "filename:key".  XView then parses that file for ":key" and extracts the 
help text associated with the key.  The help package then displays a help 
window with the help text.
