This file is intended to contain programmer's documentation on compile.  There 
is no short-term plan for completing this document. Some information on 
compiling may be found in the help file compile.help.

\section{Quick reference list for }compile



\fixedtext{boolean \bold{compile_}InitializeClass }\fixedindent{();} 

}


In a nutshell, what is this class?  (i.e., What is a short definition?)  What 
does it allow the application programmer (other readers) to do?  What is an 
example?  When would an application programmer (other readers) want to use it? 
How does it fit into ATK (if appropriate)?



\section{About this section}


What classes does the section assume the reader already knows about?  Any 
sections that are optional but useful to know about?  What sections/volumes 
are related to this one?


What are the things that only certain users (e.g., application programmers 
using a class (e.g., text/textview), inset/application programmers 
sub-classing a class (e.g., creating ctext/ctextview), system maintainers) 
need to know about?


What is the organization of this section? (use if the section is long an 
complex)


This document corresponds to ATK version <fill in> or higher, and application 
version <fill in> or higher.  This document was authored by <names>.



\section{About }compile


What is this class (extended definition)?  What are the logical concepts 
(implementation independent) of the class?  What sorts of operations on data 
does the class support?



\section{Related classes}


Briefly, what classes are related to this one that is would be 
necessary/useful for readers to know about?  For example, what classes does 
the reader need to know about in order to understand how to use the class or 
to understand the descriptions of the routines?



\section{Using }compile


Does it make sense to use this class (e.g., text/textview) or does it only 
make sense to subclass the class (e.g., view)?


What happens when the class is loaded?  When an instance is created?  When 
should an instance be created?  What are the calling conventions?  How does 
this class relate to ATK?  How does it fit within the flow of an application?



\section{Sub-classing }compile


Does it make sense to subclass this class?  What does someone who wants to do 
it need to know about?



\section{compile functions}


What are the class procedures, methods, etc. for the class?



\section{compile key bindings and proctable functions}


Does this class have any key bindings and proctable functions?  If so, what 
are they?
