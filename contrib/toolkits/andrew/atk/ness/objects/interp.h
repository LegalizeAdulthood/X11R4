 * $Log:	interp.h,v $
 * Revision 1.5  89/06/23  17:24:28  wjh
 * (Items that should not be sent to downstairs are marked "R4".)
 * 
 * Added a call to CheckForInterrupt in the function calls and internal gotos.  Thus loops can be terminated with ^G.   (interp.c)  R4
 * 
 * Changed dokeys() so it uses im_DoKeySequence.  This means it is now possible to send a key sequence which involves the message line.  (interp.c)  R4
 * 
 * Implemented DoMenu(object, menustring).   This function causes the same behavior as if the user selected the menu option.  At present the menu string must be exactly as originally defined;  see the warning above for im_DoMenu().  (interp.c, call.c)  R4
 * 
 * Changed access to Ness library routines so they are always compiled.  (They used ot get the default of NoCompilation, so they were useless.)  (call.c)  
 * 
 * Removed a superflous {} pair.  {This is purely a cosmetic change.}  (nessmark.c) 
 * 
 * Fixed value_GetStringValue.  Formerly it was getting an invalid initial value.  {The fix was done by adding a call to nessmark_Initialize() in the stackString section.}  (nevent.c) 
 * 
 * Modified the data stream so errors will not occur when a ness object is the outermost object.  The fix was to add two bytes, "00", at the end of the origin string to prevent the former occurence of a spurious "\}".  (ness.c) 
 * 
 * Fixed menu handling so Ness and child menus get posted when there is a mouse click in an inset within the Ness.  Formerly neither set of menus was posted. (nessv.c) 
 * 
 * Fixed dostmt, the function called from ness-load, which is recommended to be bound to ESC-ESC.  It was using a NULL pointer, so people were getting core dumps if they typed ESC-ESC before doing a compile.  (ness.c) 
 * 
 * Avoided an infinite loop which occurred if a library function referred to a non-existent entry point within itself.  Did this by checking to see if the library function is already Compiling just before trying to compile it.  (call.c call.hn, call.h) 
 * 
 * Revised system marker allocation so the compilation will not get a subsequent error.  (gen.c)
 * 
 * Revised system marker allocation so it expands the space available if necessary. This will make it possible to compile larger programs.  (gen.c)
 * 
 * Changed the type of TType to long from struct object *.  This will allow compilation on stricter compilers.  (interp.h) 
 * 
 * Fixed nessmark_FinalizeObject so it would not reference a NULL pointer.  {Somehow the assembler noticed this bug!}  (nessmark.c) 
 * 
 * Changed functions which deal with constant strings to have (char *) as there argument type (SaveError, exprnode_Create, ReportError, ExprError, RunError, LocateErrorFunc, QueryReadOnly, makeConst, printallerrors) or return type (Freeze, argcounterr, argtypeerr).  This prevents compile errors on picky compilers.  (interp.c, error.c, call.c, ness.c, nessv.c, search.c, nevent.c, nessmark.c, nessrun.ci)  R4 
 * 
 * Changed Imakefile to store Imakefile in checkin rule.  (Imakefile)
