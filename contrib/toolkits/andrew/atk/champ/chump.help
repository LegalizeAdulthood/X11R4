\chapter{Chump: Using Champ from a Terminal

}
\section{What Chump is


}\leftindent{Chump is part of  \italic{Champ} , a system that helps you keep 
track of events.  Champ stands for "Calendars Help Absent Minded People." 


Within Champ, Chump lets you see events if you are using a terminal emulator, 
like a PC.  Chump will also work in a Typescript window.

}
\section{Setting up to use Champ}


\leftindent{\subsection{Tell the system some events.}  }\leftindent{The first 
step in using the Champ system is to tell the system some events and dates you 
want to be reminded of.


If you are using a terminal emulator, you have to enter events into a file by 
hand.  The filename to use, and the syntax of the information to enter are 
explained in the  \italic{champfile}  help document.


If you are using a workstation and a window manager, you should use 
 \italic{Chimp  }to do this. 


}\section{Using Chump}\section{


}\leftindent{To see a list of scheduled events beginning with the current 
date, type 


\leftindent{\typewriter{chump}}


at the operating system prompt and press Enter.  A list of events for the 
current week appears in the window.  The format lists the date first, followed 
by a description of the event.  For example,

    

\typewriter{\smaller{Monday, 9/12/88: This is the second Monday in September

Tuesday, 9/13/88: John's birthday

Thursday, 9/15/88: Soccer game at Westminster College

Saturday, 9/17/88: This is the third Saturday of the month}}

 

To expand or reduce the list, append a number to the chump command.  For 
example, if you type 


\leftindent{\typewriter{chump 3 }}


a list of events scheduled for today and the next two days will appear.  The 
list above would be limited to two events.  


\typewriter{\smaller{Monday, 9/12/88: This is the second Monday in September

Tuesday, 9/13/88: John's birthday
