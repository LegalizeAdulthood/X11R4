<|,1><F41>Footer Catalog for the Release 4 Template

<unique>

<unique>

<F33>How to Use this Catalog

<unique>

This catalog is designed to be used with one of the new Release 4 
templates<#1f><F22>4_ref_temp<F0>, <F22>4_sys_temp<F0>, or <F22>4_tutor_temp
<F0>. To make this catalog effective, place it in a book in front 
of the template documents(s). Make sure that <F22>Components<F0> is 
the only Export setting selected on the catalog's Icon Selected property 
sheet.

<unique>

This catalog introduces a new way to edit footers. In the past, you 
edited footers by selecting the text anchor in a document's footer 
frame and deleting or entering new text. With this catalog, you never 
edit footers in a document itself; instead, you make all changes in 
this catalog. Those changes are automatically reflected in the document(s) 
when the catalog's export setting is turned on.

<unique>

The following are brief instructions for using this catalog to edit 
footers. For more information about catalogs, see the<F22> Catalogs<F0> 
chapter in the <F22>Document Management<F0> manual.

<unique>

<unique>

<F33>Right<#1e> and Left<#1e>Page Footers

<unique>

The following are masters for right<#1e> and left<#1e>page footers. 
Both masters are inline components; <F22>foot_rt<F0> controls right<#1e>page 
footers and <F22>foot_lft <F0>controls left<#1e>page footers. To edit, 
place the cursor between the inline tokens (anywhere within the <F22>Release 
4<F0> text) and delete or enter text as necessary. Do not cut the 
inline tokens, and do not change any of the properties on the inline 
components' property sheets.

<F33>Preliminary<#1f>Date Footer

<unique>

The following is a master inline component for the <#7f>preliminary<#1f>date" 
footer, named<F22> foot_prelim<F0>.  Edit as necessary. If you do 
not want this footer to appear, delete all text between the inline 
tokens. Do not cut the tokens in this catalog or in the document itself.

<F21>Moving the <#7f>Preliminary<#1f>Date" Footer<F0><HR>
If you want to change the horizontal position of the <#7f>preliminary<#1f>date" 
footer in a document, open the document's footer frame, select the 
microdocument that contains the <#7f>preliminary<#1f>date" text, clear 
the position lock, and execute <F21>Move<F0>!<F21> Horizontal<F0>. 
Re<#1e>set the position lock once you have moved the microdocument. 
Follow these steps for the first odd and first even page of each document. 
This is the only change that should be made to the position of footers 
and the<F22> <F0>only change that should be made locally. Do not make 
this change to the right<#1e> and left<#1e>page footer microdocuments.

<unique>

<F22>Other than changing the horizontal position of the <#7f>preliminary<#1f>da
te" footer, you should edit footers only from this catalog. Do not 
try to edit footers locally.

<unique>

<|,2><F33>Locks in the Template

<unique>

In the template, the microdocuments that contain the footers have 
locks on position, font, and cutting. Do not change any of these locks, 
with the exception of the position lock on the <F22>foot_prelim <F0>microdocume
nt, per the instructions on the previous page.

<unique>

<unique>

<F33>If You Are Exporting More than Footers

<unique>

If you are exporting more than footers into a given manual, create 
a binder icon and paste this catalog and the other catalog(s) into 
it. Keep the catalogs separate.
