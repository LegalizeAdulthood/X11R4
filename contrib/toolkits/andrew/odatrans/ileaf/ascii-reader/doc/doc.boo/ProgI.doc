<para>

This section discusses the function-call interface. Each function 
description includes the function's intended usage, a description 
of its parameters, and any side-effects.

<para>

The functions are grouped into four classes:

<list>

<"|:list", Subcomponent = yes><F0><Tab><F25>><F0><Tab><End Sub><F0>Initializati
on functions

<list>

<"|:list", Subcomponent = yes><F0><Tab><F25>><F0><Tab><End Sub><F0>Memory

read functions

<listLA>

<"|:listLA", Subcomponent = yes><F0><Tab><F20>H<F0><Tab><End Sub><F0>High-level 
write functions

<para>

Before using the <F25>ASCII Reader<F0>'s data structures, initialize 
the input file with <F25>ArFileInit()<F0> and the AR state variable 
with <F25>ArStateInit()<F0>. 

<para>

The memory management routines free the user from checking the return 
status on memory allocation calls. The two functions are <F25>ArSafeMalloc() 
<F0>and <F25>ArSafeRealloc()<F0>.

<para>

The read and write routines of greatest importance are <F25>ArDocRead() <F0>and 
<F25>ArDocWrite(). <F0>For many interfaces these are the only functions 
that will be required. These functions read and write ASCII documents 
in their entirety. The other functions within this function-class 
provide access to smaller units of a document, such as components 
or document declarations.

The second group of functions initialize various component and structure 
types.

This function allows a client to configure some of the internal measures 
and actions of AR in order to minimize the set of conversions needed 
for distance measures. If the client does not call this function, 
default values are used.  

<Cpara>

The <F25>initP <F0>structure tells AR to use a new number of <F25>Rsu<F0>'s 
per inch. All internal measures that are kept in <F25>Rsu<F0>'s are 
updated by this function. The default tabs in a component, component 
line spacing and bottom margin are affected by this conversion. The 
default component top margin is 0 and therefore unaffected. The default 
page measures and microdocument page measures are changed, and the 
conversion table for units such as picas and millimeters is updated. 
The default metric measures are likewise affected.

<Cpara>

There is no guard within AR to prevent this function from being called 
more than once. However, the results are not predictable if the basis 
of <F25>Rsu<F0>'s is changed in mid-stream.

AR needs to retain some information about the input file between read

<|,157>High-level Read functions

<rule:Adot>

<Tab.>

<paraAT>

There are two high-level read functions provided by AR.  The highest-level 
one is <F25>ArDocRead()<F0>.  It reads the entire input Interleaf 
ASCII markup document and builds an umbrella data structure to contain 
it.  This maximizes the amount of memory used, since the entire document 
is in client memory at once; it is also the simplest way to read an 
Interleaf ASCII markup document. <F25>ArDocRead()<F0> is based on 
a function named <F25>ArNextObject()<F0>, which reads part of the 
input file, builds the next top-level object that it finds, and returns 
a pointer to it.

<para>

An <#7f>object" is the next discrete structural chunk of the input 
document.  It is one entire declaration, such as <<!Page, ...> or 
one individual stream or component master from a <<!Autonumber Stream, 
...> or <<!Class, ...> statement.  In the body of the document, it 
is one entire component.  The component properties are directly available, 
while the contents are in the token buffer.  Nested objects are read 
from the input file and placed appropriately; microdocuments are placed 
in their frames, and frames are in their components, and in-line components 
are in their components to any depth of nesting.

<para>

These two functions are the only input-parsing routines available 
to a client program.  By taking this object-oriented approach, AR 
insulates the client from the details of Interleaf ASCII markup syntax.  
Because the set of parsing and output routines is complete, a client 
never needs to read or write markup directly.  The client can work 
entirely within the realm of the AR data structures.

This function returns the next high-level object in the document. 
If this object (a class definition, component, autostream master, 
etc.) contains embedded components (frames, microdocuments, inline 
components), they are included in the returned high-level object.

<Cpara>

Only objects returned by this function will have an Identifier_t as 
the first element.

<Cpara>

The <F25>ilP<F0> parameter can be NULL, but it should be a pointer 
to an <F25>Il_state_t<F0> initialized by <F25>ArStateInit()<F0>.  
When <F25>ArNextObject()<F0> is reading a component instance in the 
body of the document, it needs access to the component master in order 
to set the inheritance of properties from the master.  Likewise, when 
reading <<!Class, ...> declarations, <F25>ArNextObject()<F0> must 
have access to the class-defaults values.  All the AR code will work 
properly when the <F25>ilP<F0> pointer is NULL, but values that should 
be inherited will instead have their basic default values.  Nothing 
will be garbage, but the meaning of the output document will be changed 
when TPS loads it.

<Cpara>

The return value is NULL if an error was encountered.

<Cpara>

If the file referenced by the <F25>fiP<F0> parameter is not an Interleaf 
ASCII markup file (that is, it does not begin with the characters 
<#7f><<!"),  AR causes the client program to exit after printing a
