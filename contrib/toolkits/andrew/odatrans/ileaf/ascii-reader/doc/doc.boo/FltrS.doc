In addition to the basic <F25>ASCII Reader <F0>data structures and 
function calls, the <F25>ASCII Reader<F0> also provides a set of commonly 
used routines that make writing filters easier. At this point, the 
only services provided are string manipulation and I/O.

<para>

The <F25>ASCII Reader <F0>uses strings of <F25>short<F0>s instead 
of <F25>char<F0>s to represent character strings. In this capacity, 
the <F26>characters<F0> are <F25>shar<F0>s, and the <F26>strings<F0> 
are <F25>shring<F0>s. <F25>shar<F0>s are used because the need to 
represent other structures (frames, inline components), fonts, and 
an expanded character set requires more space per <F26>character<F0>.

<para>

The <F25>shring<F0> routines are similar to the C string functions.

<Autonum, reference, 1, First = Yes, Tagname = ssave>Ssave: Dynamically-growing 
character string services

<para>

In many parts of the ASCII Reader, there is a need to store a string 
of text when the length of the text is not known in advance. Generally 
a maximum length is known, but often the actual length is much less 
than the maximum and it would be a waste of space to allocate storage 
based on the maximum. And in some circumstances, there is no maximum 
length: the text in a component can be as large as the computer will 
allow.

<para>

AR provides a separate set of services to handle dynamically-growing 
strings. Such a string is managed by a control block that contains 
information about the location and size of the string. The services 
allocate more space when it is needed, and hide the details of storage 
management from the client routine.

<Tab><F26>Caution:<F0><Tab><End Sub><F0>These services do <F26>not<F0> 
automatically NULL-terminate the string. It is up to the client to 
add a zero value to terminate a string.

<para>

The string services are used in three ways within AR. We describe 
them here to show how they might be useful to a client program.

<para>

A simple use is the gathering of characters that make up a name, such 
as a component name or printer name. A temporary control block is 
allocated and used to collect the characters in the name (including 
an explicit NULL terminator). When the name is complete, a pointer 
to it is saved in some data structure and the temporary control block 
is discarded. The name will generally be kept for the duration of 
the program, and will not grow.

<para>

Another use is to manage the content of a component, its text and 
its tokens. Here the control block is part of a <F25>Cmpn_t<F0> variable, 
and lasts for as long as the component does. The dynamically growing 
storage is referred to as the component's <F26>buffer<F0>. The buffer 
grows in a complex way as the text and markup of the Interleaf ASCII 
markup file are read. The control block is used by several different 
routines, each using it to add its piece to the component buffer. 
These routines all use the services described here, with the result 
that the buffer grows in a uniform and consistent way. Note that in 
this case, the buffer is not NULL-terminated.

<para>

A third use of these services within AR is in managing the input stream 
of characters from the Interleaf ASCII markup file. To interpret the 
markup commands, it is sometimes necessary to look ahead in the file, 
reading past the <#7f>current" character. Characters read ahead must 
be saved and processed in their turn. They are kept in a block of 
storage managed by the Csave services. Also, it is sometimes necessary 
to insert characters into the input stream that are not in the input 
file. The string services allow characters to be placed on the front 
of the read-ahead string.

%C

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

shar

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

A 16-bit value is read from the argument. It is truncated to 8 bits, 
and the result is printed as per %c.

<Row, "row">
<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

%#C

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

shar

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

A 16-bit value is read from the argument. If it is in the range of 
printable ASCII, it is printed as per %c. Otherwise it is printed 
in the Interleaf ASCII markup standard form of out-of-range characters, 
<<#xxxx>. Note that this puts seven bytes into the output. Note also 
that the value is not truncated.

<Row, "row">
<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

%#c

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

char

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

Like %#C, except that an 8-bit value is read from the argument.

<Row, "row">
<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

%S

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

pointer to shar (shring)

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

The shring is read until the terminating zero or until the format 
precision is exhausted. Each shar is printed as per %C. 

<Row, "row">
<|,181>
<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

%#S

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,

pointer to shar (shring)

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

The shring is read until the terminating zero or until the format 
precision is exhausted. Each shar is printed as per %#C.

<Row, "row">
<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

%Q

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

pointer to shar (shring)

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

The shring is printed according to the rules of Interleaf ASCII markup. 
The caller does not need to check for any special conditions in the 
shring.

<para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

The double-quote character " is printed before the beginning and after 
the end of the characters in the shring. If the double-quote character 
occurs inside the shring, it is printed twice. If the character '<<' 
occurs inside the shring, it is printed twice. Characters outside 
the range of printable ASCII are printed in <<#xxxx> form.

<Row, "row">
<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

%#Q

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

pointer to shar (shring)

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

Like %Q, except that the single-quote character ' is used in place 
of the double-quote character, and it is printed twice if it occurs 
within the string.

<Row, "row">
<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

%q

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

pointer to shar (string)

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

Like %Q, except that 8-bit values are read from the argument.

<Row, "row">
<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

%#q

<Cell, Vertical Alignment = Center><para,
	Left Margin =		0 inches>

In TPS 3.0, a <#7f>character" or <#7f>fundamental text unit" required 
7 bits, and fit into a C <F25>char<F0> variable. That character set 
is too limited for the needs of TPS 4.0, which now uses 14 bits in 
a 16-bit C <F25>short<F0> variable to hold a <#7f>character". These <F25>short
<F0>-based characters and character strings are referred to as <F25>shar<F0>s 
and <F25>shring<F0>s. The standard C output function <F25>fprintf()<F0> 
is not capable of printing <F25>shars<F0> and <F25>shrings<F0> as 
text, since it does not anticipate <F25>short<F0>-based characters. 
For this reason, we have created <F25>ArFprintf()<F0> and <F25>ArSprintf()
<F0>, functionally like <F25>fprintf()<F0> and <F25>sprintf()<F0> 
except that they do <F25>shar<F0>s and do not do <F25>float<F0>s.

<Cpara>

These functions can be especially useful when debugging. Because <F25>ArDocWrit
e() <F0>will write a complete document, they are not generally required 
for generating the output document.

<Cpara>

In interfaces that collect data from a document for storage in other 
forms (like databases, other word processors, graphics libraries, 
etc), the routines could be used for converting <F25>shar<F0>-based 
strings to <F25>char<F0>-based ones.
