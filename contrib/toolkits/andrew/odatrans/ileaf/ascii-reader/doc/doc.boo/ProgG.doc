<|,42>C Naming Conventions

<rule:Adot>

<Tab.>

<paraAT>

There are several naming conventions used throughout AR:

<Cstuff>

something<F21>_t<F0><Tab><Tab><Tab>A <F22>typedef<F0> definition of 
a data structure or type<HR>
something<F21>P<F0><Tab><Tab><Tab>A<F22> pointer variable<F0> has 
a trailing <F21>P<F0> on its name<HR>
<F21>Ar<F0>SomeThing()<Tab><Tab>A function name begins with <F21>Ar<F0><HR>
<F21>AR<F0>_MAX_SIZE<Tab><Tab>A constant or other global value begins 
with <F21>AR<F0><HR>

<para>

All names that start with <#7f>Ar" or <#7f> AR" should be considered 
reserved by the ASCII Reader.

<titleA>

Include files

<rule:Adot>

<Tab.>

<paraAT>

There are two required include-files <F25>ar5defs.h <F0>and<F25> ar5csave.h.
<F0> Note that they guard themselves against re-inclusion and can 
therefore be <F26>#included<F0> multiple times. These files should 
be included in any module that uses AR data types or services.

<titleA>

makefiles

<rule:Adot>

<Tab.>

<paraAT>

On UNIX systems,<F25> makefile<F0>s can be used to control the compilation 
and linking of AR-based programs. MMS files are the VMS equivalent. 

<para>

The only points to note in the <F25>makefile<F0> is that when they 
are compiled the C source modules must have access to the include 
files, and that when linked, the program must have access to the AR 
object library.

<Cstuff>

# use your own path to AR<HR>
# the AR directory contains the AR object library and include files<HR>
AR<Tab><Tab><Tab>= ../ar<HR>
INCLUDES<Tab>= -I. -I${AR}<HR>
# location for runnable images<HR>
BIN<Tab><Tab>= ../bin<HR>
#image that we want to build is dependent on the image file<HR>
filter:<Tab><Tab>${BIN}/filter<HR>
#the filter is dependent on object modules and AR libraries<HR>
${BIN}/filter:<Tab>filter.o<Tab>${AR}/AR5_lib.a<HR>
<Tab>cc -o ${BIN}/filter filter.o<HR>
#objects are dependent on C source and headers<HR>
filter.o:<Tab><<include files> ar5defs.h ar5csave.h<HR>
<Tab>cc ${INCLUDES} filter.c<HR>

<titleA>

Unsupported ASCII Markup

<rule:Adot>

<Tab.>

<paraAT>

There are a few features of ASCII Markup that are not currently supported 
by the ASCII Reader.

<list>

<"|:list", Subcomponent = yes><F0><Tab><F25>><F0><Tab><End Sub><F0>The 
Include command

<list>

<|,43><"|:list", Subcomponent = yes><F0><Tab><F25>><F0><Tab><End Sub><F0>Tracin
g objects

<list>

<"|:list", Subcomponent = yes><F0><Tab><F25>><F0><Tab><End Sub><F0>Outline 
objects

<listempty1>

<"|:listempty1", Subcomponent = yes><F0><Tab><Tab><End Sub><F0>The 
data in outline-fonts are encrypted (for commercial license reasons, 
required by the vendor of the outlines) and we do not provide the 
method of encryption. But the client has full access to the structure 
of the diagram, just as there is full access to the text content of 
the document.

<para>

TPS does not generate <F26>Include<F0> commands, so this shouldn't 
be a problem when reading an ASCII markup document. <F26>Include<F0> 
files can be avoided when generating ASCII markup by including the 
data directly into the main document.

<para>

There is no current work-around for capturing tracing and outline 
objects.

<titleA>

Operating Limitations

<rule:Adot>

<Tab.>

<paraAT>

The <F25>ASCII Reader <F0>is not able to read multiple documents at 
the same time. If this is required, completely read one document before 
reading the next. AR is able to write to multiple output files without 
difficulty.
