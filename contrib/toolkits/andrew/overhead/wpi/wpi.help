}
\section{What wpi is

}\leftindent{
\italic{Wpi} is a command-line utility for modifying your White Pages entry. 
 See the white-pages Help document for a description of the White Pages 
database.

}
\section{Starting wpi

}\leftindent{
The easiest way to start wpi is to simply run type


\typewriter{\leftindent{wpi}


}at the operating system prompt.  This will start a question/answer session, 
prompting you to enter new values for fields of your white pages entry.  Just 
press \bold{enter} if you don't want to change the field, type 
\typewriter{NONE} if you want to empty the field, or type the new value for 
the field.  A request will be mailed off for processing.  The changes you 
request should take effect somewhere between one to three days after you 
receive confirmation of your request in the mail.

}
\section{Warnings

}\leftindent{
You can change your mail forwarding address with \italic{wpi}.  Be careful, 
since you may accidentally forward your mail to someone else, and they will 
wonder why they are getting mail for you.


Also note that processing wpi requests takes time.  You will not see these 
changes with  \italic{finger},  \italic{forward},  \italic{wpi},  or 
\italic{wpq} for a few days.  Be patient!  If you receive a success report, 
your change will be processed.

}
\section{How wpi works

}\leftindent{
\italic{Wpi} mails your request to the White Pages Administrator account. 
 There is a  \italic{cui}  daemon running which periodically checks for mail 
in this account and filters it through the \typewriter{wpiupdat} program. 
 This program will either approve your request, deny it, or send it off to a 
system administrator for approval.  If your request is reasonable, the 
administrator will approve your request and it will then be processed.


After \typewriter{wpiupdat} finishes processing, it puts your request in a 
special file which is picked up by the White Pages rebuild process, which runs 
daily.  Once the rebuild process finishes, your changes will become visible to 
everyone.  The process is usually completed daily, but can take up to three 
days.

\section{Quick reference

}\leftindent{
\programexample{wpi [-A] [-F] [-s] [-c cell] [-u user] [-f field [value]]*

}
\description{\bold{-c}  Specify the cell to work in

\bold{-u  }Specify the login name of the entry to modify (not 
recommended)\description{

}\bold{-f  }Specify the field to modify (such as Fwd, for forwarding address), 
and optionally the value (if absent, you will be prompted).  Can be repeated. 
 The fieldnames are subject to change, but you can determine their names by 
inspecting the output of \typewriter{wpq -p}, where the field names are the 
one to three letter codes after the initial dollar sign ($) on the beginning 
of each line.  Of course, you may not be authorized to make changes to 
arbitrary fields.

\bold{-s}  Silent mode, don't make so much noise (not recommended)

\bold{-F  }Force errors to be warnings (not recommended)

\bold{-A  }Assume I am an Administrator (not recommended)

}

\section{Advice

}\leftindent{
A quick way to change your fowarding address is to use:


\programexample{wpi -f Fwd newaddress@hostname


}which is equivalent to


\programexample{forward newaddress@hostname


}but the forward program has a few forwarding-address specific options.
