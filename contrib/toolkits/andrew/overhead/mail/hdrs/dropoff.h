There are three historical formats for packets sent from the dropoff library routine to the dropoff-daemon process (currently part of queuemail).  The first two formats include a workstation UID and a single pair of packed authentication tokens, as handled by the tokens.c module.  The second format also includes 32 bits of flags.  The third format includes the flags word, a workstation UID, a count of pairs of tokens following, and a directory (e.g. $HOME/.Outgoing) in which enqueued requests can be found.  Each packed pair of token is followed by a null-terminated text string of which the first byte is a flag: 2 if this isn't a primary token and 3 if it is.  The rest of the text string is the name of the cell to which the pair of tokens applies.

Thus, the first packet format, in byte addresses, is
0-3/	uid	(32 bits, network byte order)
4-.../	pair of Venus tokens, packed by tokens.c
Its length is DROPOFF_PACKET_LENGTH.

The second packet format, in byte addresses, is
0-3/	flags	(32 bits, network byte order)
4-7/	uid	(32 bits, network byte order)
8-.../	pair of Venus tokens, packed by tokens.c
Its length is DROPOFF_PKT_LEN.

The third packet format, in byte addresses, is
0-3/	flags	(32 bits, network byte order, with DF_NEW_FMT on)
4-7/	uid	(32 bits, network byte order)
8-11/	numpairs	(32 bits, network byte order)
12-.../	null-terminated string naming the directory to process
then a sequence of:
	pair of Venus tokens, packed by tokens.c
	null-terminated string naming first whether this is the primary token, then the cell to which this pair of tokens applies
until the packet runs out.
Thus, the length of this packet cannot be determined ahead of time.
