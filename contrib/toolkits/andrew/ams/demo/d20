\bold{\bigger{\bigger{\center{Some current statistics from CMU}}}}


The following statistics, though curent as of May, 1989, will become quickly 
obsolete, given our past experience:


\leftindent{\italic{Number of public or semi-public bboards on the system}: 
 ~1900


\italic{Typical number of bboards an individual subscribes to}: ~40


\italic{Maximum known number of bboards one individual subscribes to}:  468


\italic{Annual volume of bboard posts}:  ~10 Gigabytes


\italic{Mean time between message postings on all public bboards}:  22 seconds


\italic{Number of magazines (user-edited bboards culling gems from other 
bboards)}:  34


\italic{Number of registered Andrew users at CMU}:  ~8400


\italic{Number of CMU users who read mail or bboards regularly using AMS}: 
~3100


\italic{Number of non-CMU sites subscribing to the multi-media "andrew-demos" 
distribution list}:  33 (at least 5 of which are redistribution lists)

}
Some of the non-CMU sites are also using AMS on a very large scale; for 
example, an IBM site in Rochester, Minnesota has nearly as many AMS bulletin 
boards as the CMU installation.
