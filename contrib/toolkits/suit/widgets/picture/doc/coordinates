	Here is some explanation about the coordinates.


	The picture widget supports two types of coordinates, the widget
coordinates and the event ( window ) coordinates.


	In the widget coodinates, the x-coordinate increases to the right and
the y-coordinate to the upper direction.

	By default, the view locates at the position shown below:

                                    y
                                    ^

                                    |

	This means the graphic element you see in the picture window have
negative y-coordinates.

		Mmmmmh ....., pretty confusing .....

	But if you don't like negative coordinates, you can change the view
position by setting some resources ( StNviewY [ and StNviewX ] ) or scrolling
the view ( with the scrollbar or 'Shift<Btn1>' operation with no selection ).


	The event ( window ) coodinates are relative to the upper-left corner of
the view, and here the x and y coordinates increase to the right and lower
direction, respectively.

	This coordinate can be specified as parameters to the picture widgets's
public functions.
