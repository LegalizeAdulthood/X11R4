	Here is some supplementary explanation for the text primitive.


	If you click the left mouse button on the text primitive ( within the
circumscribing rectangle ), the character cursor appears at the mouse pointer
location, and you enter the editing mode.   In this mode, you can perform the
usual string operation ( deletion, insertion, etc. ) to this text primitive.

	To select the text primitive itself with the left mouse button for
some graphics operation, you have to click it exactly on the circumscribing
rectangle.   This requires much skill, so I recommend you to employ the other
selection method.   Press the right mouse button, drag it so that the rectangle
displayed completely encloses the text primitive, and release it.

			Much easier, isn't it?

Of course, you can apply this method both for other primitive types and for
multiple primitives, too.
