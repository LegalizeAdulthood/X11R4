	PicDemo is an example application making use of the picture widget.
	It just creates an instance of the picture widget, but already serves
as a graphic editor ....., I hope.

	Files with suffix '.picw' in this directory are figure data files
provided for demo purpose.

	To start playing with PicDemo, you can follow these steps.

1.	Read in some sample resources:

		xrdb -m S.Xresources

	This is not necessary, and has little sense for monochrome displays.

2.	Run PicDemo:

		PicDemo -sb

	Omit '-sb' if you don't want scrollbars to be displayed.

3.	Click the middle mouse button to pop up the main menu.

4.	Move the mouse cursor to the 'Read  ->' menu entry.

5.	Enter a picture file name ( ex. 'figure1.picw' ) into the dialog box.

6.	Click the 'Merge' or 'Override' button.

3.- 6.	These steps can be skipped if you

	also specify '-f figure1.picw' at step 2.

			or

	read in an additional resource at step 1. with

		xrdb -m SF.Xresource

	to have the XtNfile resource set to the above file name.

7.	Now, give full scope to your imagination and guess how to continue ...

	If your imaginative power should lack a bit,

	consult the file 'picture.n' in the 'doc' directory.

				Have fun!
