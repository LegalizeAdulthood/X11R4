	The picture widget is a widget for drawing, editing andd managing
graphic elements.
	Instantiating one will virtually generate a graphic editor.

	The contents of each subdirectory is as follows:

	St
		header files

	doc
		documents

	lib
		source code
		object code and library will be generated here

	examples
		Sample programs making use of the picture widget

NOTE
	The picture widget uses not only the Xaw(Athena widgets) but also the
MenuBox widget, provided in the 'contrib/widgets' directory of X.V11R3.
	The Imakefile assumes the configuration system to be compatible with R3
( that is, the MenuBox widget directory exists as a sibling [./../MenuBox] ).
If this is not the case, the Imakefile has to be modified a bit.
