This contribution consists of documentation and C header files for
the Display PostScript System extension to X Windows.

CONTENTS
	
README		This file.
	
dps-protocol	The specification of the extension protocol.

XDPS.h		The C header file defining constants for the extension,
		analogous to X.h.

XDPSproto.h	The C header file defining the data structures for
		the extension protocol, analogous to Xproto.h

NOTE: In XDPSproto.h, the name of the extension is specified as
"Adobe-DPS-Extension", which is the name registered with the
X Consortium.  However, the DPS extension in Digital's UWS 2.2
DECWindows server is named "DPSExtension".  Your client should query
both names to determine if the extension is available.

The Display PostScript System extension to X Windows is 
specified in the Display PostScript developer manuals,
available in a reference binder from Adobe Systems.
The developer reference binder includes the following 
documents:

	The Display PostScript System: Perspectives for Software Developers
	PostScript Language Extensions for the Display PostScript System
	Display PostScript Client Library Reference Manual
	Display PostScript pswrap Reference Manual
	PostScript Language Color Extensions
	Display PostScript/X Window System Supplement
	
Because the documentation is over 200 pages long, we have arranged to
ship hardcopy to interested parties upon written request.  To obtain
the Display PostScript developer manuals, send a check or money order
for $45.00 (payable to Adobe Systems) to cover the cost of production
and shipping to:
