README -- xrobots

  xrobots is a game that runs on X Windows.  It is based on the robots
game found on unix.  See the man page for a description of the options 
and game play.

  Both an Imakefile and a traditional makefile (Makefile.tra) included.  
If you use the traditional makefile, you'll have to edit two lines as a 
minimum.  (The lines which define "INCDIR" and "LIBDIR")  If you don't 
want to go through that hassle, you can always use imake.
 
Compile time parameters:  
 	  MAXX, MAXY -- these control the number of 'cells' in the playfield.
 	the default is 35x20.  The realistic maximum these can be on a 
 	1152x900 screen (ie most sun 3/50's) is about 50x40.  With a larger 
 	playfield, the scores will be higher and the game length longer, but
 	some graphics may appear slower.  With the default playfield, scores 
	in the 6000 range can be achieved.

 	  MAXSCORES -- the number of high scores that you want to keep.
 	The default is 20.

 	  The default directory for the binary and score file is the current 
	directory.  You'll have to modify the makefile or copy the binary
	if you want it to install elsewhere.  xrobots will attempt to
	create the scorefile (SCOREFILE) at runtime.  

  There is a little bsd-ish stuff in score.c.  flock is used to stop a race 
condition.  If you don't have a bsd-like flock, you could probably 
comment it out.  The race condition (multiple users writing to the 
score file) is probably rare.  If SYSV is defined, this will be ifndef'd
out.

  If your compiling this under X11R3, define the term R3 in the makefile or
imakefile.  This will make the include references look like those expected
by X11R3 instead of X11R4.
