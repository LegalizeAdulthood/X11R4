Installation Notes

	You will need to modify the DIR define in defs.h to match
where you will be installing the xlife pattern libraries. The value
will be what xlife pops up as the default load path.

	Past that, not much needs to be done. Just compile and have
at some of the more interesting patterns shipped along with the
program

	breeder : the full blown breeder pattern which constructs
			and infinite number of glider guns as it
			moves to the right in the universe. This
			is *big*.

	cmu : well, if you didn't know already, CMU's official logo
		is a 14 degree square. Run this to see *why* it is.
		Just kidding ... really >:-)

	plus lots and lots of nifty patterns which have been snarfed
	from all over the place. You should see somewhere in there
	just about every interesting little creature you ever heard
	of. If you come up with any more good patterns (hopefull smaller
	than the breeder :-), please send them over to us!

	If you feel up to it, the TODO file lists some things we would
like to add into the game ... if you implement any of these, please send
us the patches, and we'll take care of wrapping the whole thing together
and submitting them into comp.sources.x
