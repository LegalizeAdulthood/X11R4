roids is an X11 game implementing the old Atari Asteroids video game.

As far as I know, this should be easy to install on anything running
X11R3.  However, I have only tried it on Ultrix 2.0.  It requires Xt,
Xaw, and Xmu.

I hereby grant permission for this game to be freely redistributed by
anyone.  I merely ask that I am given credit, that this notice
remains, that any changes made are also sent to me, and that nobody
ever tries to sell it for any money.
