You are a trainee at a military training center.  You participate in war
games against other robot tanks in various combat and training games.
Depending on your skill in these games, you can increase your rank, receive
better equipment, etc.  The games are played in a large maze-like complex
filled with movable force fields, goals, outposts, etc, that can be
configured to suit the needs of the game.  In addition vehicles can be
designed in various locations in the complex.  The ammunition used in
the games is fake.  Damage to vehicles and explosions are simulated, even
though the vehicles and maze themselves are real.  This is where games
like Ultimate, Race and Capture are played, and players get to choose
their maze, vehicle, settings, etc.

One day, there are reports of some robot tanks fighting with real ammunition.
Several trainees are sent out to investigate the problem.  Real battles
begin, with real ammunition, in an attempt to save the base from its
own traitor robots.  You go out in your vehicle, possibly team up with other
friendly robot tanks to fight the enemy.  Here your performance determines
your rank, and hence the amount of money you will be given to make your
next vehicle or repair your old one.  The mazes that you fight in will be
preset, and will become tougher as you move farther out into enemy territory.

The reason why the robots are attacking is because they have been reprogrammed
by a robot drone ship that has landed inside the base.  It is reprogramming
the bases robots to attack the base, and gain control of it, and eventually
the planet.  So eventually, the player will reach an area with alien looking
vehicles surrounding a large ship, and the final battle will ensue.

A game like this will obviously take a while to play, so the character and
vehicle and game state will be saved to disk after each playing session.
You will increase in rank, design and build better vehicles with your money,
and possibly win back the base.  After that, you can go back to the training
games, or try the battle scenario on a higher difficulty level, etc.

The complex will be divided up into many mazes, some designed for games, others
just random terrain, others for specific tactical situations.  Many of the
mazes in the battle scenarios will be different, though, since the drone
ship has some robots sent to take over some maze configuration centers.
