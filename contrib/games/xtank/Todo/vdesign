I believe some of this has already been fixed...

			   VEHICLE DESIGN

increase power of smaller engines to give the vehicle designers
more reasonable choices.

increase cost of small vehicles, since they're so hard to hit.

decrease speed penalty for having a larger vehicle.

make acid sprayers less optimal
	more expensive?
	lower damage?
	more weight?

make spiders roomier, space = 4000?

make rhinos faster and more maneuverable

make malices less gross
	less maneuverable/speedy
	more expensive

make armor heavier
