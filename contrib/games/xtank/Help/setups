Combatants Interface

  Clicking on a grid item will cause it to be highlighted.
    If the right button was clicked, the selection will be erased.

  Clicking on the lower menu which matches the selection inserts that item.
  Clicking on empty space does not affect the selection contents.
    If the left button was clicked, the selection will move right.
    If the middle button was clicked, the selection will move down.
    If the right button was clicked, the selection will not move.

  Clicking on a lower menu which does not match the selection has no effect.

  A combatant without a vehicle is ignored.
  A combatant without a team will default to team neutral.
  A combatant CAN have a player and a program at the same time.

This combatant list is used for Play Customized.
