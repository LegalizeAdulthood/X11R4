                             Multi-player

To start a multi-player game, do the following:

   1.  On one machine type 'xtank' to start up an xtank program.  This
       machine is called the server.

   2.  Have all other machines add the server machine to their
       xhosts (type 'xhost <server_machine>').

	    Ex.  xhost w20-575-41

   3.  On the server, click Add Players, enter the number of machines to
       add, and enter their names as <machine1>:0, <machine2>:0, etc. 

	    Ex.  w20-575-42:0

The server will then put up an xtank window on every machine.
Everyone in turn will be asked to enter their xtank name and vehicle
name.  All future games will involve all added players.  If an added
player wants to exit the game, he or she can simply type 'Q' during a
game.

			Ways to speed up multi-player Xtank

1.  Startup xtank on a separate machine that no one is using, (in this
    example, w20-575-30).  Have all the players type

		xhost w20-575-30

    Then on w20-575-30, type

		xtank w20-575-51:0 w20-575-52:0 w20-575-53:0 w20-575-54:0

    This will start a game where machine 51 has the menu interface,
    and 52, 53, and 54 will be playing.  You can also add more players
    with the Add Players menu option.

    The important thing here is that the Xtank program is NOT running
    on a machine that is displaying the graphics.  Thus the work is spread
    out over 5 machines (in this case) instead of 4 machines (with one
    doing computation and display at the same time).

2.  Change the sync mode to 2,4,8, or 16 frames using the keys o,p,[, and ].
    Higher numbers make the game faster, but animation is more jumpy.

3.  Don't play with any robot programs.
4.  Play on RT's or PVAX machines
5.  Play with point bullets turned on.  (faster but more confusing)
6.  Don't use programs that draw on the screen during the game (xclock,xload)
