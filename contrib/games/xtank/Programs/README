This directory contains programs to dynamically link into Xtank.
Many of them are for testing or are unfinished.  Some of them
(notably frog.c, runner.c, goalie.c) actually play some of the games
in Xtank.  Not all of them will work with Xtank as it currently stands,
requiring simple changes to the Prog_desc structure.  Programs
that #include "xtanklib.h" still need to be modified.  Programs that
#include "xtanklibnew.h" will work with the current version.
