There is not much here of value, except perhaps the dmaz program

Makefile	makefile for porgrams resident here

dmaz		VAX executable for printing out mazes in ascii.
dmaz.c
mazedesc.c	sources for dmaz

objcreate.c
objcon.c
ovjview.c	Source files for a programs used to manipulate .obj files
objcon.c	(collections of bitmaps in Src/Objects directory)

x10tox11.c
x11tox10.c	bitmap conversion programs (rather obsolete, I think)

obj3d.[ch]	Aborted attempt at sneaky hidden line algorithm.

r16.c
r1to3.c
r4.c		Old bitmap rotators (very poorly written, no filtering).
