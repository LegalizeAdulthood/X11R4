** Utility to convert 3d objects into optimized C code to do hidden line

** #points
** x y z
** x y z
** ...
** #lines
** p0 p1
** p0 p1
** ...
** #faces
** #edges e0 e1 e2 ...
** #edges e0 e1 e2 ...
**
** Objects must have the property that a given line is either totally
** visible or totally obscured when the object is viewed from the z=k plane.
