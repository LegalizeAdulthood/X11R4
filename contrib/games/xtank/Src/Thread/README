This is the current version of the multi-threading code.
It is machine dependent and currently works for the Vax and RT.
On most systems, switching between threads requires saving registers
and the stack, and then doing a setjmp() or longjmp(), with little
or no assembly hacking.  One of the systems that requires assembly
hacking is the VAX.  One of the systems that doesn't is the RT.
