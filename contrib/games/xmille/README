Notes on porting xmille:

	The bitmaps in 'cards' are set up for a color display, they probably
will not be readable in monocrome without a bit of editing.  Also, the
card display routines insist on color, so those will need fixing as well.

	The major porting headache of mille is roll.c.  You'll probably
have to fix it for your machine, it's terrible now -- but that's what came
with it and it works on *my* machine...

	I'll cheerfully accept bug reports in xmille, and may even be
willing to maintain a current version; but I wash my hands of this mess by
putting it into the public domain, I don't care what you do with it.
