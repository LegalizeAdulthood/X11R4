This directory contains most of the examples used in O'Reilly and
Associates' Xlib Programming Manual.  All the complete routines
and many of the fragments are provided here, all within working 
programs.  (Some of the smallest code fragments are not included.)

The basicwin directory includes numerous versions of a hello-world
application, each demonstrating different X features.  Exactly what
each demonstrates is not always obvious - see the README file in
each directory and look at the code.

This directory also includes the major application described in the 
book, \fIwinman\fR and \fIbasecalc\fR.  \fIwinman\fR is a very simple
window manager (not updated to the current ICCCM), and basecalc is a 
calculator still useful for converting numbers between bases and for 
doing binary, octal, and hexadecimal math.
These applications will be installed if you type "make install".
