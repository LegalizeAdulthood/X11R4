You may need to recreate the Makefile to
generate one that will work on your system.

To rebuild the Makefile under R4, use the ximake.sh shell script provided
in the TOP/util/scripts directory, something like the following:

TOP/util/scripts/ximake.sh TOP

where TOP is the full path of the mit directory of your X distribution
sources.

By default, the Makefile will use libraries and include files in
the X source tree.  This will only work if you have built the
Core distribution and have not yet cleaned out all the object
files and libraries from the source tree.  However, many people
clean out these files after installing the executables and libraries
in order to make disk space for compiling things in contrib.

To construct a Makefile that will build an application using the
installed libraries and include files instead of the X release
source tree, edit the TOP/config/site.def file, adding the following
lines (the file itself describes where):

#ifndef UseInstalled
#define UseInstalled
#endif

Then repeat the process described above for generating the Makefile. 

If you want to compile the programs under R3, use the following command
when you start the make:

make DEFINES=-DX11R3

If you want to compile the programs with -g to let you debug using
a debugger such as dbx, use:

make "CC=cc -g"

If you do not have the sources for X, you may not have the
ximake.sh script, and you may not have the configuration files
that \f(CWimake\fP requires.  If this is the case, you can try
the provided default Makefiles, or you can compile manually:

cc -o progname progname.c -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lX11
