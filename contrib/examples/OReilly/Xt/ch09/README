xpixmap.c  This was an abortive attempt at hardcoding a pixmap
	   by invoking a converter from the application.  However,
	   this particular converter requires an XtConvertArgsRec 
	   argument list, and I could not find a way to specify the
	   arguments properly.

(If you make it work, drop me a line at uunet!ora!adrian or adrian@ora.uu.net.)
