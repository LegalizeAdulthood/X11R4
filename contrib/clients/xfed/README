[I modified xfed to display the bounding box, ascent, descent,
 bearings etc.  Deals with R3 fonts now. Seems to work, sort of -- it
 collects all COMMENT lines after the STARTFONT, regardless where they
 appeared in the input file. I believe thiis what the BDF document
 states. Good for displaying the fonts, but doesn't work when you try
 and modify a character outside the bbox in most directions.  delinted
 it a bit too. For a full-blown font-editor, modify to use ImageEdit
 widget?  Should make it so it converts the character being edited to
 a grid, and allows you to do arbitrary things with the character, not
 just change pixels within the existing bounding box. A generalized
 bitmap editing widget, based on the bitmap program would be nice. -

This is a little font editor, which allows you to modify
the bitmaps of .bdf files.
