Pretty much a complete rewrite of xplaces to make it ICCCM conformant (more
or less) and give it more smarts about icons, icongeometry, and geometry. It
also prints a DISPLAY= at the start -- Bourne shell syntax.

It gets the WM_COMMAND property and reconstructs the command line with the
window's present geometry (rather than the geometry it started with),
icongeometry and iconic state if any. It also uses the WM_CLIENT_MACHINE
property to determine whether the application is running remotely or not, if
the latter, it generates a line of the form 'rcmd remotehost command
arguments...'. Th ercmd script in this directory works for machines with BSD
style remote shell (rsh) It should work with reparenting window managers as
well - tested with twm (an alpha version that is sort of ICCCM conformant as
well as the old version).

It's flexible enough that it should be adaptable to other toolkits with just
a change of Option descriptions. See the comment before the Option typedef.
