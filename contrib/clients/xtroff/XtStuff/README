Some useful widgets which aren't part of any official widget set.  We have
'em as libXtStuff.

The Menu widgets from contrib/menus after Dana Chee's extensive fixes
to get them to compile and work. Thanks Dana. Included because the
context diffs were longer than the code.

The Window widget from Chris Peterson's xman - also mentioned in a
posting. Wonderful thingy, er, widget. Thanks Chris.

The Minibuf widget is mine. I got tired of trying to convince the Text
widget to do single line editable text input way back in the X10 days.
It's probably possible now (xwebster does it) For file completion, you
should define -DDIRENT if your system has dirent.h instead of sys/dir.h.

	Mark.
