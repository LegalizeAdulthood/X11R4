This little awk program is used to display the characters
in a font that is used by troff (ditroff).  e.g.

	psfd /usr/lib/fonts/devpsc/R | pic | troff | lpr -n

will display the characters that can be printed in the "R" font.

I used this to test out xtroff and the characters that can be displayed
with the various fonts:

	xtroff -full -command 'psfd R | pic | troff -Tpsc -F /usr/lib/X11/troff'

or:

	xtroff -full -command 'psfd S | pic | troff -Tpsc -F /usr/lib/X11/troff'

Of course, this can also be used to display them on the PostScript printer:

	psfd S | pic | troff -Tpsc -F /usr/lib/X11/troff | psdit -F /usr/lib/X11/troff | lpr

The reference to the "/usr/lib/X11/troff" directory is to get the font
description file:

	/usr/lib/X11/troff/devpsc/DESC.out

that may define more characters than defined by your PostScript file.
