While I am checking out the troff output that you are sending to me,
Please run the following script on the discription file that you
have for transcript/PostScript.  Ours is located at /usr/lib/fonts/devpsc,
but it sounds like yours is at /usr/lib/troff/devpsc or something
like that.  Anyway, unpack this shar.ar and run:

	psfd path/devpsc/R | pic |troff -Tpsc | lpr -n

Let me know what you get.  This should match the character set on
page 252 of "The Adobe Red Book".

	PostScript Language Reference Manual,
	Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-10174-2

	psfd path/devpsc/S | pic | troff -Tpsc | lpr -n

should match the character set on page 253.
