The files in this directory make the ditroff description files
for the xtroff "device" and its fonts.  The Makefile uses two
awk programs (adobe.awk and bdfdit.awk) to generate the discription
files.

The first awk program (adobe.awk) is used to map characters into
the character set used by ditroff.  Some characters are left
unmapped, while other characters, that had been unmapped, are enabled.

The second awk program (bdfdit.awk) serves two tasks:
(1)	It maps from the .bdf format of character description to the
	discription used by makedev.

(2)	It is called by the makefile to help create the device description
	file "DESC".

This program contains the mapping from .bdf character names
to ditroff input character escape sequences: e.g., \(em.
This mapping is called "ditmap".  The mapping called "ascii" serves to
identify the normal printing ascii characters (which may have synonymns
in ditmap).

"Make install" will install all of the .out files into the destination
directory from which xtroff reads them.  This is usually
/usr/lib/X11/troff/devpsc/  (devpsc stands for the PostScript device).
