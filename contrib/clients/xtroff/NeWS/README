Convert Sun NeWS font to X11 format.
This assumes that your Sun system has the NeWS fonts in

	/usr/NeWS/fonts

and the the program "dumpfont" is located in your search
path.  "dumpfont(1)" is normally located in

	/usr/NeWS/bin

My version of dumpfont generates an old version of the .bdf
file.  The news.awk script changes what is needed for bdftosnf
to be able to handle the file.  Some care has been taken to
get correct character widths for times-roman font.  The other
fonts get some arbitrary number for SWIDTH.

The font name has been chosen to match what is expected by
xtroff.  i.e.
	devpsc.f.sz.dpi

	where	f = one or two character font name
		sz = point size of font
		dpi = dots per inch of font

The character location is the same as that assigned in the NeWS
font.  This matches the assignment for the first 256 characters
in the PostScript font.  The fonts also match the the widths
described for the PostScript fonts so troff can be run using
-Tpsc and previewed with xtroff.

The files in this directory also make the ditroff description files
for the xtroff "device" and its fonts.  I have included the width
description files (R I B etc.)  These cannot be extracted from the
bdf files that discribe the NeWS fonts since the SWIDTH field is
not discribed correctly.

"Make install" will install all of the .out files into the destination
directory from which xtroff reads them.  This is usually
/usr/lib/X11/troff/devpsc/  (devpsc stands for the PostScript device).
