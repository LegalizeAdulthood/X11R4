* Variable number of lists (instead of 3), variable no. of entries, etc.
  Perhaps turn it into a widget?

* Use X selections instead of cut buffer.
  This would enable clients to obtain pathnames through selections, and the
  client would not have to link in the XsraSelFile code.

* Some clients may want to have more control over what happens in the
  XtAppNextEvent-XtDispatchEvent loop.

* Another idea is a text widget with file name completion that can be embedded
  in an application. The completions would only be popped up when the user
  wants to see them.

* Make another package for completion of not only filenames, but anything.

* launching by eg double click

* scrolling and selection through keyboard

* if file to be read, it must exist

* allow the user to specify the filename pattern e.g. *.c

* customized buttons eg vi

* directory stack option

* search (RE)

* file stat info
