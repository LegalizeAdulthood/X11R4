#
# This file describes how to build xdir, a simple application that uses the
# XsraSelFile file selection dialog package.
#
# The program is linked with Athena widgets (Xaw) by default. It can be linked
# with Hewlett-Packard widgets (Xw) by defining one or more of the defines below
# and adding Xw to the list of libraries. Defining `SEL_FILE_XW' is equivalent
# to defining all of them.
#
# -DSEL_FILE_XWFORM
# -DSEL_FILE_XWPUSHBUTTON
# -DSEL_FILE_XWSCROLLBAR
# -DSEL_FILE_XWSTATICTEXT
# -DSEL_FILE_XWTEXTEDIT
#
# -DSEL_FILE_XW
#
# By default, the program compiles correctly in the R4 environment, where Xaw
# header files are under <X11/Xaw/>. To compile in an earlier environment, use:
#
# -DSEL_FILE_PRE_R4_XAW_XMU
#
# Normally, the program should be linked with the R3 or a later version of the
# Xt Intrinsics, but it can be linked with the R2 Xt by defining the following:
#
# -DSEL_FILE_R2_XT
#
# System V Release 2 users will need something like Doug Gwyn's directory
# package (posted to comp.sources.unix), and will need to define the following:
#
# -DSYSV
#
# System V Release 3 users will need to define the following:
#
# -DUSG
#
