Tue Dec 12 14:06:54 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* renamed TeXxResources -> xtexResources

	* no longer use TEXFONTS in the makefile; now uses
	  xtexResources.tfmPath to find TFM fonts.

Sun Nov 26 22:19:49 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Argle. XeT taken. Use xtex instead.

Fri Nov 24 17:20:08 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Renamed texx2 -> XeT for X11R4

Tue Nov 14 10:20:16 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Fix problem in DviPage::DviDisplay, where I forgot to initialize
	startHH and startVV when starting a new cached string. Also, flush
	the string cache before more actions (specials & the like).

Mon Oct 30 11:25:31 1989  Dana A. Chee  (dana at dino)

	* (mark.c) add parens around summation so that amount of space
	  malloced is correct.

	* (file.c) add amounts to strncpys

Fri Oct 27 20:38:53 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

Thu Oct 26 11:24:41 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* Released as 2.10

	* Added a menu box showing the pages marked for printing.

	* Flush pending character cache when doing right/down movements.
	This makes umlates work correctly.

	* Clean up ``flushing the pending character cache'' in DviPage.c,
	adding routine DviDisplayFlush & wrapping much stuff in structure.

	* Fixed computation of spPerDot in DviPage - makes for longer runs
	of characters (typically entire words now). Much faster.

	* Make dialog clear box an option, since the dialog code works
	correctly now.

	* Allow use of the Table widget rather than form.

Thu Oct  5 15:16:17 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at foobar)

	* (many files) made all interaction with the program occur
	  though action procedures. Enhanced printing options, page
	  marking (now has stack & push/pop of marked pages),
	  magnification interface, etc. Now *requires* application
	  default file.

	* (dialog.c) improved dialog code by deleteing top lines
	  rather than entire dialog when dialog is full.

	* (all files) renamed files

	* (texx2-error.c) includes Ultrix as knowing about vsprintf.

	* Following bugfixes from: Hiroto Kagotani (kagotani@cs.titech.ac.jp)

	* (dvi-simple.c) FALSE incorrectly defined, but not used.

	* (DviPage.c) possible to over-run dvi stack space,
	  increase allocate stack space.

Sun Aug  6 23:39:11 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* (DviPage.c) Check that charwidth table exists before
	  ref'ing it. If it doesn't, assume chars take maximum
	  width (does this always exist?). Fix for PC/RT AIX/X11R2.

	* (texx2-error.c) From: Mark Davies <mark@comp.vuw.ac.nz>
	  Include hpux as knowing about vsprintf.

Wed Jul  5 08:47:06 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Added distinction between horizontal and vertical dpi
	  because many monitors (Sun lores) aren't uniform.

Sat Jun 10 16:34:59 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Released as 2.9

	* (texx2-page.c) when reloading document, you return to proper
	  logical page, not the physical page.

Tue Jun  6 12:16:55 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* (texx2-font.c) make font names always be in lower-case

	* (many) added actions & ability to not show buttons on the
	  dvi page. This lets us view entire pages at once.

	* (many) added options to set topOffset & leftOffset.

Wed May 31 08:47:18 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* (texx2.c) add -pageMaxWd and -pageMaxHt options to set max

	* (texx2-page.c) remove ``mag'' button, it's not used enough

	* (texx2-page.c) removed ``resize'' and ``resizable'' attributes,
	  putting them into the .ad file.

	* (dvi-simple.c) regiserFont - fix OBO in font width compute loop.

Tue May 16 12:01:12 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* repackaged as 2.8.7

	* made glyph placement know about actual width of glyphs;
	  improves placement, making document look better.

	* added MaxDrift resource to DviPage.h

Mon May 15 15:10:36 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* repackaged as 2.8.6

	* installed accelerators, provided default Texx2.ad.
	  accelerators between the DviPage and every button
	  on that page. accelerators between the filename
	  input buffer and everything on that page.

	* fixed texx2-page.c, file pushForwardButton to not let you
	  walk past last page (OBO).

	* repackeged as 2.8.5

	* (texx2-font.c) Calculation of mag ignored mag specified in
	  document. Fixed.

	* (texx2-file.c) Made the file name be stuffed into the input box

Sun Feb 26 16:44:46 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Compensate for scroll-bars. Now, mag=333 on a sun3 gets rid
	  of horiz scroll.

Sat Feb 25 13:19:50 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* texx2-page.c - added TeXPageSlamPages, in case we fail
	  to open a file and need to close exising windows. If we
	  don't, they can move around or redisplay, referencing dead
	  data structures.

	* texx2-page.c - reopening a file now leaves pages at the same
	  page number in the new file. this means you don't have to
	  reposition yourself when you open a file.

	* Released as 2.8

	* texx2-page.c - split TeXPageNewFile into two parts, because
	  value of DviTotalPages changes after an open, causing
	  bogus free().

	* texx2.c - stat the command line file name to make certain
	  it's a regular file before doing a setFile

	* texx2-mark.c - plug last double free? Now explicitly zero variables
	  after *all* frees.

Fri Feb 24 14:47:13 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

        * Released as 2.7

	* texx2.c - allow single argument to set the file name

	* DviPage.c - fix problem with inlines & optimization. Fontdefs
	  weren't being skipper properly, causing font names to be displayed.

	* texx2-page.c - optimize tied pages for single-page-ahead
	  with foreward travel (avoid freeing next page until it gets it)

	* texx2-page.c - fix double free in TeXPageNewFile (forgot to zero)

	* dvi-simple.c - fix double free for DviCount (forgot to zero)

	* dvi-simple.c - use strncpy

	* texx2-page.c - found out about XtNallowShellResize.
	  remove include of ShellP.h

	* texx2-font.c - reverse order of -mag and -scaled in error
	  message to make cut & paste buildfonts easier

	* Imakefile - remove tabs

	* texx2-error.c - Apply patch from Dana to fix over-write of
	  dialog box.

	* DviPage.c, DviPage2.c - removed setGC, use single globalGC
	  which is rebuilt on each redisplay.

	* DviPageP.h - removed `clearGC', renamed setGC to globalGC

	* texx2-file.c - merged BuildPageLevel into BuildFileLevel.

Fri Feb 24 14:50:36 1989  Dana A. Chee  (dana at dino)

	* texx2-error.c - removed unneeded resource XtNresize (not used in
	  text widgets).
	  
	* texx2-file.c - changed strcpy to proper strncpy; created widgets
	  in order used for chaining (Form widget goes through child list
	  once to place children, if the order of their chaining is
	  different from their creation order, the results will not be
	  satisfactory).

	* texx2-widgets.c - let widgets dimension the form; build widgets
	  in correct order for chaining (Page within File now, see above
	  reasons).

	* texx2.c - use proper program and class names for XtInitialize.

Thur Feb 23 17:30:10 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* texx2-page.c - Added `large' and `small' buttons
	* texx2.c - Added `largeMag' and `smallMag' resources

Sun Feb 19 17:30:10 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Released as 2.5

	* Added `clear marks' button

	* Fixed error in DviPageWidget - wasn't setting the setGC
	  properly, causing redraws to fail when not using backing store

Fri Feb 17 17:30:10 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

        * Added ``tied'' pages, Imakefile, man page

Tue Feb 14 11:49:11 1989  Dirk Grunwald  (grunwald at flute.cs.uiuc.edu)

	* Changed all args to widgets to be built use XtSetArg instead of
	automatic aggregate initializations.

	* Changed all callbacks to be built using XtAddCallback instead
	of automatic aggregate initializations.

	* Changes texx2-error.c to build a temporary _iobuf structure
	for _doprnt to print erorr messages if vsprintf is unavailable.

	* (texx2-page.c) made pushGotoButton goto the page with a count[0]
	field matching the selected page number, as opposed to the ordinal
	page number.
