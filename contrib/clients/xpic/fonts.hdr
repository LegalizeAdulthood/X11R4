 | that has the form:
 | R	-*-times-medium-r-normal--*-*-75-75-*-*-iso8859-1

Hmm. I was thinking of a reverse philosophy, where the program did an
XListFonts("*-*-*"), and extracted the appropriate fields. Then use
the FAMILY_NAME-WEIGHT_NAME-SLANT to match the font based on a table
such as you suggest, but a bit simpler i.e.

R	times-medium-r
I	times-medium-i
B	times-bold-r
BI	times-bold-i
TR	times-medium-r
TI	times-medium-i
TB	times-bold-r
TD	times-bold-i
C	courier-medium-r
CO	courier-medium-o
CB	courier-bold-r
CD	courier-bold-o
H	helvetica-medium-r
HO	helvetica-medium-o
HB	helvetica-bold-r
HD	helvetica-bold-o
nc	new century schoolbook-medium-r
nC	new century schoolbook-medium-i
Nc	new century schoolbook-bold-r
NC	new century schoolbook-bold-i
A	charter-medium-r
AI	charter-medium-i
AB	charter-bold-r
AD	charter-bold-i
S	symbol-medium-r
S2	symbol-medium-r

Could use the POINT_SIZE and RESOLUTION_Y fields to compute pointsize
relative to the display resolution. This means one isn't stuck with
the 75 dpi fonts only. (BTW, DECWindows comes with itc souvenir-demi,
itc lubalin graph-book,itc avant garde gothic-demi and some others)

What do you think? (I enclose a font field parser below if you're
interested in following this idea up -- includes a main() -- just strip
out main() if you find it useful to call getfontname() and select the
appropriate elements from the array -- have to free each non-null
pointer in the array once you're done with it)

Can't you get the widths from the font by querying them?  You could
then do XLoadQueryFont when the font is loaded, and store those
widths. Thus avoid loading the fonts widths until really necessary,
and avoiding a width file.

As for the collating sequence, how about something like the
devpsc/[A-Z]?  files you already have, except without the width
information in files with the names "iso8859", or anything else in the
charsetencoding field? fontspecific could be mapped with the
foundry-family-weight-slant perhaps. Or just foundry-family?

Note that you extract most of the width information via your awk
scripts at present from bdf. All that information can be handled at
runtime instead, if you were to do it in C. (I have some splay tree
code, or hash table code that i could send you if you want, for the
associative arrays -- I may have to chase up a COPYRIGHT notice for
each of them from the authors, but I don't think either would mind)

Interesting idea. I'll look at it later. Here's the font name parser.
