I was checking out xpic on the optimaX. The xpic screen is too big to fit
and some of the commands don't appear even on resizing.

[The wonders of resources. Turns out xpic can be convinced to fit on
 the Optima screen. The command
                xpic -ph 90 -gs 6 -xrm 'xpic*vSpace: 1'

 should get it to just fit. For a more permanant setup, try adding
 something like the following to your X11defaults file

        #if defined(CONSOLETYPE_go200)
        xpic.pageHeight:                90
        xpic.gridSpacing:               6
        xpic*vSpace:                    1
        #endif

 The pageHeight is in tenths of an inch (don't ask!), so it is cut
 down from the default 105 (10.5 inches) to 90 (9 inches)
 The gridSpacing is the number of pixels apart the grid points, so
 it is reduced from the default 8 to 6.
 The vSpace resource indicates that the vertical space between all the
 buttons and labels in the menu should be 1 pixel (the default is 4)

 For more information on X resources, see
 /csri/doc/X11/tutorials/resources.txt, for more information on xpic
 resource classes, see /csri/doc/X11/xpic/xpic.doc. For specific names
 of resources used by xpic, see the manual pages for the widgets used
 by xpic in /csri/src/X/contrib/widgets/Xhp/doc/manpages.n. (Sorry,
 there isn't any other documentation on them) - moraes]
