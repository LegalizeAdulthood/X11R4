This is a sample document, formatted with the \fI-me\fP macros, and is
meant to demonstrate the inclusion of \fIxpic\fP figures in
\fItroff\fP. For the record, this document was printed using the commands
.(e
psfig test.psfig.me | psroff -me
.)e
.pp
Without further ado, a simple, somewhat abstract figure, drawn
with \fIxpic\fP,\**
.(f
\** by Victor Greenberg (\fIvg@dgp\fP)
.)f
then converted to PostScript\(rg\**
.(f
\** PostScript is a registered trade-mark of Adobe, Inc.
.)f
using \fIx2ps\fP 
.(e
x2ps victor.x > victor.ps
.)e
and included by the simple \fIpsfig\fP
commands
.(e
\&.F+
figure victor.ps
\&.F-
.)e
.F+
figure victor.ps
.F-
.pp
As we can see, there's nothing to it, really!
Some might argue that the previous picture was hardly a test of the
capabilities of \fIxpic, x2ps, psfig,\fP and PostScript\(rg. True, but
it is the thought that counts, wouldn't you say. Still, to quell any
doubts, let's move on to a somewhat more intricate picture.
.pp
This picture was drawn using a larger than life drawing area\**, 
.(f
\** by Marcel Leblanc (\fIleblanc@godzilla.ele\fP)
.)f
and was
scaled down for conversion using the command 
.(e
x2ps -s 0.5 marcel.x > marcel.ps
.)e
and included in this document by
.bp
.(e
\&.F+
figure marcel.ps
\&.F-
.)e
to give:
.F+
figure marcel.ps
.F-
.pp
Actually, the scale of 0.5 is a little cramped - this figure was
actually meant to be seen in landscape mode, at a slightly larger 0.6! 
That can be achieved by:
.(e
x2ps -s 0.6 -r marcel.x > marcel.ps.land
.)e
and included in the document by
.(e
\&.F+
figure marcel.ps.land
\&.F-
.)e
As can be seen, \fIx2ps\fP provides all the information that
\fIpsfig\fP needs to correctly position the figure on the page, and
leave enough space for it. Alas, not wise wnough to handle page breaks
correctly, it seems!
