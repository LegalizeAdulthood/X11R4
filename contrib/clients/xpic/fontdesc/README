These describe the font mappings between xpic fonts and:
	X fonts (xpic), 
	PostScript fonts (x2ps), 
	Troff + PostScript fonts (x2pic)
	TeX + PostScript fonts (x2tpic)

Site dependent - if you don't have a PostScript printer, many of these
definitions will be useless, and you may need to provide substitutes.

For each of the font names in the first column in the xpic file, there
should be a corresponding name in each of the other files so that the filter
can map an xpic name onto some font that actually exists in the printer.

Users can override these, of course.
