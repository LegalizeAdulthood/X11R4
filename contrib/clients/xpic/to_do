This varies from things that probably should be fixed, to things that
would be sort of nice, but which i doubt if I'll ever get around to.
Not to be interpreted as things that may get fixed - just things that
I would like to fix.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Scale, Rotate, Mirror

Clean up obj_line and obj_spline - too much code duplication there.

Checkpointing using changes

Multiple buffer handling.

Enhancements:
	ordering of gels so that we can use filled regions, Raise, Lower
	initially fill regions with setgray
	later fill regions with general bitmaps - load and save bitmaps
	grab bitmaps from the screen
	macros, groups

Text display routines that interpret TeX/Troff codes like \bullet or
\(bu so that we get a better WYSIWYG effect. means taking stuff from
dvix/xtroff and using that for char code mapping. Get really amibtious
and add some level of equation support.

Generalize so that all global variables are in a struct to which a pointer
is passed for all routines - eg. picWin becomes pic->win, picDpy becomes
pic->dpy, gcInvert becomes pic->gcInvert, etc. This is a step towards
widgetification of xpic. Should have obj_ stuff truly objectified using
pointers to procs to call them, rather than the present unwieldy case
statements. Should be able to add objects easily then. (AddObject()?)
