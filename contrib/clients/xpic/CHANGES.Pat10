to be released 

- Minibuf now understands cut, emacs style - by clicking to set the mark
  with the right button. (Also sets selection owner to none, so you can paste
  the cut text into xterm)

- changed the font mapping to use X font names and extract dpi and
  point size from them. The old devsun/devpsc is junked -- this matches
  version 4.8 xtroff. Saves disk space on fonts and delinks xpic from
  xtroff. fonts.alias no longer needed. New file -- xfname.c
