.SH NAME
fig \- Facility for Interactive Generation of figures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fig
\fB[ -r ]\fP 
\fB[\fP \fIfile\fP \fB]\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Fig 
is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
interactively on the screen of a Sun Workstation. 
It can only be run within the SunWindows environment and requires a 
three-button mouse.
.I File 
specifies the name of a file to be edited. The description of objects in
the file will be read at the start of \fIfig\fP. 
.PP
The output from \fIfig\fP can be printed by first using 
.I f2p
(\fIfig\fP to \fIpic\fP(1) translator, also known by its previous
name \fIftop\fP(1L)) to translate it into 
.IR pic (1)
language.
The \fIpic\fP(1) file can be saved and edited like ordinary text file.
To print the file one should issue the command:
.br
\fCpic file | troff\fP
.br
adding any required options to the invocation of \fItroff\fP(1).
The file may be used in conjunction with any other \fItroff\fP(1) preprocessors.
.PP
Another way to produce a hrad copy is to use \fIf2ps\fP (the fig to postscript
translator) to produce a postscript file from \fIfig\fP file.
The postscript file can be sent directly to a postscript printer
via
.IR lpr (1).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-r
Change the position of the panel window to the right of the canvas window
(default: left).
.SH "GRAPHICAL OBJECTS"
The objects in \fIfig\fP are divided into \fBprimitive objects\fP and
\fBcompound object\fP. The primitive objects are: \fIARC\fP, \fICIRCLE\fP,
\fICLOSED SPLINE\fP, \fIELLIPSE\fP, \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP,
\fISPLINE\fP, and \fITEXT\fP.  A primitive can be moved, rotated,
flipped, copied or erased.
A compound object is composed of primitive objects. The primitive objects
that constitute a compound can not be individually modified, but they can
be manipulated as an entity; a compound can be moved, rotated, flipped,
copied or erased.  An extra function that can be applied to a compound
object is \fBscaling\fP, which is not available for primitive objects.
.SH "DISPLAY WINDOWS"
Three windows comprise the display area of \fIfig\fP: the 
panel window the message window, and the canvas window. 
The message window always appears below the others;
it is the area in which messages are sent and received. from the
The menu window can be placed to the left or right of the
the canvas window (default: left).
.SH "POP-UP MENU"
The pop-up menu appears when the right mouse button is pressed with the
cursor positioned within the canvas window.
Positioning the cursor over the desired menu entry and releasing the
button selects a menu entry.
.PP
There are a number of file accessing functions in the pop-up menu.
Most of the time when one of these functions is selected, the user
will be asked for a file name.  If the specified file can be located
and the access permission are granted, \fIfig\fP will carry out
the function.  However in case things go wrong, \fIfig\fP will
abort the function and printed the causes on the message window.
.TP
.I Undo
Undo the last object creation or modification.
.TP
.I Redisplay
Redraw the canvas.
.TP
.I Remove all
Remove all objects on the canvas window (can be undone).
.TP
.I Edit file ...
The current contents of the canvas are cleared and objects
are read from the specified file.
The user will be asked for a file name.
This file will become the current file.
.TP
.I Save
Save the current contents of the canvas in the current file.
If no file is being edited, the user will be asked for a file
name as in the "Save in ..." function.
.TP
.I Read file ...
Read objects from the specified file and merge them with objects already
shown on the canvas.
(The user will be asked for a file name.)
.TP
.I Save as ...
Save objects on the screen into a file specified by the user.
(The user will be asked for a file name.)
.TP
.I Status
Show the name of the current file and directory.
.TP
.I Change Directory
Change the working directory.  Any file name without a full path name
will employ the current working directory.
.TP
.I Save & Exit
Save the objects in the current file and exit from \fIfig\fP.
If there is no current file, the user will be asked for a file name.
No confirmation will be asked.
.TP
.I Quit
Exit from \fIfig\fP, discarding all objects. The user will be asked to 
confirm the action, by clicking the left button.
.TP
.I Save as BITMAP ...
Create a bitmap picture of the drawings for use with other tools (for example,
for use as an icon).  The smallest rectangular area of pixels
that encompasses the figure is written to the named file 
(the user will be asked for a file name) from
top row to bottom and left to right (in Sun raster format).
Only \fITEXT\fP objects that are parts of compound objects will be
treated as parts of the picture; other texts are saved as objects in
\fIfig\fP format following the bitmap data.
The coordinates of these text objects can be used
to identify locations on the bitmap.
.SH "MENU WINDOW MANIPULATION FUNCTIONS"
Icons in the menu window represent object manipulation functions,
modes and other drawing or modification aids.
Manipulation functions are selected by positioning the cursor over it and
clicking the left mouse button.  The selected icon is highlighted, and
a message describing its function appears in the message window.
.PP
The left and middle buttons are used to creat and modify objects in the canvas
window.  Most actions start with clicking of the left button
and end with clicking of the right button.
There is no need to hold down a button while positioning
the cursor.
.SH "MENU WINDOW COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS"
Entries in the panel window can be classified into two categories:
object creation/modification/removal commands (only one of which may be active
at any one time), and drawing aids (which act as toggle switches).
There are two ways for drawing circles, two for ellipses, two for splines
and two for closed splines.
There are two basic splines.  One is the interpolated spline
in which the spline pass thorough the entered points (knots).
The other is the normal spline in which on control points are
passed by the spline (except for the two end points in the open spline).
.SH "OBJECT CREATION/MODIFICATION/REMOVAL"
Multiple commands are grouped thematically in the following
descriptions (which is listed alphabetically).
.TP
.I ADD/DELETE ARROWS
Add or delete arrow heads for \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP, \fISPLINE\fP
or \fICLOSED SPLINE\fP objects (points of a \fIBOX\fP can not be added or
deleted).
.TP
.I ADD/DELETE POINTS
Add or delete points for \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP, \fISPLINE\fP
or \fICLOSED SPLINE\fP objects (points of a \fIBOX\fP can not be added
or deleted).
.TP
.I ARC
Create an arc.  Specify three points using the left button.
.TP
.I BOX
Create rectangular boxes.  Start with the left button and terminate with
the right button.
.TP
.I BREAK COMPOUND
Break  a compound object to allow manipulation of its component parts.
Click the left button on the bounding box of
the compound object.
.TP
.I CIRCLE 
Create circles by specifying their radii or diameters.
Click the left button on the canvas window, move the cursor until the
desired radius or diameter is reached, then click the middle button to
terminate. The circle will be drawn after the pressing of the middle button.
.TP
.I CLOSED INTERPOLATED SPLINE
Create closed or periodic splines.  The function is similar
to \fIPOLYGON\fP except that a closed interpolated spline is drawn.
The spline will pass through the points (knots).
.TP
.I CLOSED SPLINE
Create closed or periodic spline objects.
The function is similar to \fIPOLYGON\fP
except that a closed spline will be drawn instead of polygon.
The entered points are just control points; i.e., the spline will
not pass any of these points.
.TP
.I COPY
Copy object.  Click the left button over part of the object to be
copied (for \fICIRCLE\fP and \fIELLIPSE\fP
objects, position on their circumferences).  Drag the object to the desired
position and click the middle button.
This function as well as the following three functions 
(\fIMOVE\fP, \fIMOVE POINT\fP, \fIREMOVE\fP)
will cause point markers (manipulation aids) to be shown on the canvas window.
There are no markers for \fICIRCLE\fP or \fIELLIPSE\fP objects.
.TP
.I ELLIPSE
Create ellipses using the same procedure as for the drawing of circles.
.TP
.I GLUE
Glue the primitive objects within a bounding box into a compound object
(the bounding box itself is not part of the figure; 
it is a visual aid for manipulating the compound). 
.TP
.I INTERPOLATED SPLINE
Create (cubic spline) spline objects.
Enter control vectors in the same way as for creation of a
\fIPOLYLINE\fP object.
At least three points (two control vectors) must be entered.
The spline will pass through the entered points.
.TP
.I MOVE
Move objects in the same way as in \fICOPY\fP.
.TP
.I MOVE POINT
Modify the position of points of \fIPOLYLINE, \fIBOX\fP, \fIPOLYGON\fP,
\fIELLIPSE\fP, \fIARC\fP and \fISPLINE\fP
objects.  Click the left button over the desired point, reposition the point,
and click the middle button.  Note that \fIBOX\fP and \fIPOLYGON\fP 
objects are internally stored as \fIPOLYLINE\fP
objects, and therefore moving certain points may open these objects.
.TP
.I POLYGON
Same as \fIPOLYLINE\fP
except that a line segment is drawn connecting the first and last
points entered.
.TP
.I POLYLINE
Create polylines (line segments connecting a sequence of points).
Enter points by clicking the left button at the desired positions on the
canvas window.  Click the middle button to terminate.
.TP
.I REMOVE
Remove (or delete) objects.
.TP
.I SCALE COMPOUND
Only compound objects can be scaled.  Click the left button
on a corner of the bounding box, stretch the
bounding box to the desired size, and click the middle button.
.TP
.I SPLINE
Create (quadratic spline) spline objects.
Enter control vectors in the same way as for creation of a
\fIPOLYLINE\fP object.
At least three points (two control vectors) must be entered.
The spline will pass only the two end points.
.TP
.I TEXT
Create text strings. Click the left button at the desired position on
the canvas window, then enter text from the keyboard.
Terminate by clicking the middle button or typing the return key.
.TP
.I TURN
Turn \fIPOLYGON\fP into a \fICLOSED INTERPOLATED SPLINE\fP object, or
turn \fIPOLYLINE\fP into a \fIINTERPOLATED SPLINE\fP object.
.SH "DRAWING AIDS"
Drawing aids act as toggle switches. More than one can be selected at a time
(except for \fIGRID\fP and the line drawing modes).
.TP
.I AUTO FORWARD/BACKWARD ARROW
Automatically add forward/backward arrow heads to \fIPOLYLINE\fP, \fISPLINE\fP
or \fIARC\fP objects.
.TP
.I FLIP
Invert the object (middle button) or produce a mirror-image copy of an
object (left button). Point to part of the object ("the handle"), click
the appropriate button.
.TP
.I GRID
Display either the quarter- or half-inch grids (left button).
.TP
.I MAGNET
Round points to the nearest 1/16 of an inch.
This affects every function, and is provided as an alignment aid.
.TP
.I UNRESTRICTED
Allow lines to be drawn with any slope.
.TP
.I MANHATTAN
Enforce drawing of lines in the horizontal and vertical direction only.
Both \fIMANHATTAN\fP and \fIMOUNTAIN\fP can be turned on simultaneously. The
creations of \fIPOLYGON\fP, \fIPOLYLINE\fP and \fISPLINE\fP objects are
affected by these two modes.
.TP
.I MOUNTAIN
Enforce drawing of only diagonal lines.  Both \fIMANHATTAN\fP
and \fIMOUNTAIN\fP can be turned on simultaneously. The creations
of \fIPOLYGON\fP, \fIPOLYLINE\fP and \fISPLINE\fP objects are affected
by these two modes.
.TP
.I MANHATTAN MOUNTAIN
Allow lines to be drawn at any slope allowed when in
MOUNTIAIN or MANHATTAN modes.
.TP
.I LATEX LINE
Allow lines to be drawn only at slopes which can be handled by LaTeX picture
environment lines: slope = x/y, where x,y are integers in the range [-6,6].
.TP
.I LATEX VECTOR
Allow lines to be drawn only at slopes which can be handled by LaTeX picture
environment vectors: slope = x/y, where x,y are integers in the range [-4,4].
.TP
.I ROTATE
Rotate the object (middle button) or copy (left button) +90 degrees.
.TP
.I SOLID/DASHED LINE STYLE
Toggle between solid and dashed line styles. The dash length
is fixed at 0.05 inch.
.SH BUGS
Text strings will appear differently on hard copy, because the display
fonts are fixed-width fonts while the fonts used by \fIpic\fP(1) are
variable-width fonts.
.PP
A double quote in a text string should be preceded by a back slash if the
it is to be printed through 
.IR pic (1).
.PP
Objects that extend beyond the canvas window may cause image shrinkage in
hard copy printed by
.IR pic (1),
since it will try to fit every object onto a single 8.5" x 11" page.
.PP
Ellipses which are too narrow may cause \fIfig\fP to loop forever.
.PP
Objects which are created while one of the 
.I grids
is on may appear ragged. This can be corrected by selecting \fIRedisplay\fP
from the pop-up menu.
.PP
The X11 cursors are not the original ones but chosen from
X11's cursor font.
.PP
Righthand panel is not supported. It should be possible to do
that but Ken was too lazy.
