FIG 1.4 Release 2

Added features:
===============

1) Interpolated spline (open and close).
2) Dotted line style.
3) Blinking vertical bar cursor for entering character string in
   canvas and message window.
4) Character strings editing feature both in entering text objects
   and file names in message window (by relocating the blinking cursor
   within the string).
5) F2ps (fig to postscript filter).  Although dashed and dotted line
   style are not rendered as such on the screen for objects other than
   polylines, the objects on hard copy produced with f2ps will be
   rendered with the line style under which the objects are created
   in fig.

Changes:
========

1) Output format (ref: FORMAT1.4).  However fig 1.4 and its associated
   filters (f2p and f2ps) can read fig 1.3 format but fig 1.4 will only
   create output in the new format.

2) Format of bitmap is now conform to the "iconedit" format (The first two
   lines are comment lines indicating the width, height, etc.  Each short
   word (16 bits) is followed by a comma except the last one.).  Here is
   an example of the comment lines.

   /* Format_version=1, Width=33, Height=6, Depth=1, Valid_bits_per_item=16
    */

   A row of bitmap is multiple of sixteen bits; however its actual width
   (in "Width=..") may be not.

   The only exception to the format is that text objects which are not part
   of any compound are appended to the end of the file.  They provide a
   way to locate point on the bitmap.

Customizable characteristics:
============================

1) The fonts used in fig are expected to reside in the
   directory /usr/lib/fonts/fixedwidthfonts. If the fonts in
   your system are not under the name directory, appropriate
   changes should be made in file font.c.

2) The size of fig can be changed by modifying two constants
   in file "const.h", namely CANVAS_WIDTH and CANVAS_HEIGHT.
