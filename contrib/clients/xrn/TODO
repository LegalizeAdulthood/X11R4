BUGS

- put in the cancel checking code...

- detect file too big in "include file"...

- if all the articles in a group get killed or cancelled when you
  enter the group, then the point is reset to the top of the window,
  not the next group.

- Text widgets are being used when there is no source around....

- double clicking will occassionaly leave you at the bottom of the 
  top window, instead of at the top

- bindings don't work in ADD/ALL modes

- 'Go to Article' of an article already on the screen screws up 'read' markings

- busy cursor in dialog boxes, message pane, when double-clicking

- fold mail messages, allow header line to specify breaks (like xmh)


Miscellaneous:

- put in a wildcard for *ButtonList, so you get the order for the buttons
  you care about with the rest coming at the end.  That way you don't miss
  any new buttons.

- reread the .newsrc file if it has been changed

- highlight/different font for subject lines in the article text 
  window (need a better text sink).

- have a 'show all subjects' button that builds the list with all read 
  and unread subject lines (this should be a toggle thing).

- if you goto an unsubscribed group, ask if you want to resubscribe

- option to flush keyboard/mouse events after getting into a new mode
    - on slow machines, some people click ahead

* make sure multiple selected items work on all commands (as in mark):
  save, kill
  - hook up 'saveRangeOfArticles'


Searching:

- buttons should not work during subject search
    sort of works....  maybe do a popup grab of nothing 
    for `continue' - need ^C back...

- article body searching

- case insensistive subject searching for `artSubSearch'

KILL files:

- pop up menus for kill options

- make subject kill rebuild the subject text, not work on the string, 
    but on the data structures

- add edit kill file (need editable disk source text widget)

- add kill author buttons (and don't default manage them, just local kill sub)

- need a kill range of articles

- cache kill information (especially global kill),
  use much better matching routine
