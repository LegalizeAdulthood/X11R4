XRN release (6.3):

- bug fixes
  - domain name handle incorrectly in some cases
  - search dialog box buttons deactivated once a search
    is started

- alterndate mailer available - calls 'send' rather than 'sendmail', 
  thus 'mh' aliases can be used (see ALT-MAILER)

- for the MIT X11R4 release: programmatic scrolling of the text widget
  is disabled.  It will be turned back on once I get a copy of R4 and
  figure out how to do it.

- added strtok for those that don't have it in libc.a
- documented the new confirm boxes
- goto article screwed up for out of range article number, fixed

XRN release (6.2):

bug fixes
- print for VMS fixes (misinstalled patch)
  [thanks to Kevin Herbert <herbert@gr8ful.enet.dec.com>]
- popup dialogs work better with sticky focus window managers

  to a group

key bindings are no longer lost after using pop up dialogs.

information box geometry can now be specified:
	xrn.Information.geometry: 

articles can now be sorted by subjects.  See xrn.sortedSubjects.
  sorting is case insensitive and based on the first 24 characters

"include file" now does tilde expansion

posting failures put you back in the composition window

default action for confirm dialog boxes is now 'yes'.

support for the macII running A/UX 1.1 (System V Rel 2 with BSD networking)
  [thanks to glenn@mathcs.emory.edu (Glenn T. Barry)]

support for HPUX
  [thanks to jp@hplb.hpl.hp.com (Julian Perry)]

even better kill file support
- regular expressions are supported in the kill pattern
  (still missing: all the various possible commands that can be used)
- better kill file entries generated

NN 'Re^#:' is understood and dealt with.

confirm boxes are now available on a per-button basis.
See xrn.confirm in the man page.

subject next now uses a case insensitive/24 character comparision

rn bindings are in the app-defaults file and are now the default bindings

internals
- better 'mesgPane' interface
  [thanks to mtoy%there.esd.sgi.com@sgi.sgi.com (Michael Toy)]



XRN release (6.1):

bug fixes
  - insertion point for compose windows now in the right place
  - tabs and new lines can now be in *ButtonList: X resources
  - occasionally xrn would die due to not being able to open
    the newsrc temp file - this has been fixed
  - garbage text in error label during subject next gotten rid of
  - group names can now be longer than 32 characters
	'hp-factory.software-eng.excalibur' can now be read
  - busy cursor appears all of the times when XRN is busy
  - top window redraws correctly - going from all/ng mode to
    article mode, if the group was empty, you would pop back out
    to all/ng mode, but without any text in the top window
  - control C now aborts a subject search
  - exiting out of All mode had some problems
    (thanks to Rich Simoni <simoni@strat.stanford.edu>)

popup mesg window
  - no more output to stderr
  - much of the error/warning output that went to the top info/help
    label now goes to the mesg window

defines to deal with various toolkit/window manger problems
  - see config.h

confirm box on XRN quit/exit

key bindings now work in all widgets, not just the button box

VMS support (thanks to Kevin Herbert <herbert@gr8ful.enet.dec.com>)

xrn checks to see if another xrn is running - the .rnlock file
  used by rn is not used.  XRN stores the host that XRN is running
  on in addition to the process id.

key bindings are now exported:
  - four new resources/command line options:
	addBindings, artBindings, allBindings, ngBindings
  - see the man page for more information

Set of RN-like keybindings for XRN
  (thanks to Jeff Wallace <jeffw@scam.Berkeley.EDU>)

New configuration parameter: SUBJECTS (config.h)
  - the number of subject lines to prefetch when doing a backwards
    subject search.  The default is 10

turning off kill file support:
  - for those of you that don't use kill files, the searching 
    for kill files can be turned off.  The kill buttons remain
    if you want to add something to a kill file, but they will
    not be processed.  See the +/-killFiles option.

ngLastGroup changed to ngPrevGroup
  - last group confused some people who thought it meant go to
    the last group displayed in the newsgroup index.

new button in article specific pane: print
  - print an article, uses the 'printCommand' resource/command line option
    (defaults to 'enscript')

new button in composition pane: include file
  - includes a file in a posting - like Meta-I in the text
    widget, but: (1) does not screw up your keyboard bindings,
    and (2) has an accelerator.

including an article now only includes the text (strips the header).
  - this can be changed via the 'includeHeader' option.
  (thanks to Paul Raveling <raveling@isi.edu>)

the .newsrc file can now be automatically updated when leaving article
  mode - see the `updateNewsrc' option.

slightly better KILL file support
  - killing based on author name supported
  - more formats of kill file entries supported

articles can be saved into newsgroup `folders', like 'xmh'.  see the
  saveMode option (thanks to Paul Raveling <raveling@isi.edu>)

More ways to specify the domain, hidden host, new hidden path, ...
  (thanks to Frederick M. Avolio (avolio@decuac.dec.com)
  - see config.h

USC ISI app-defaults file for XRN included (isi.app-defaults)
  (thanks to Paul Raveling <raveling@isi.edu>)

'abort' option in the death notifier dialog now dumps core in
the real stack rather than the signal stack (thanks to KJ Pires
<kjpires@ic.Berkeley.EDU).

Compiles with GCC.


XRN release (6.0):

Man page now even better reflects reality.

Much faster startup and rescan.

Can specify the order and number of buttons for each mode via
X resources or the command line: ngButtonList, addButtonList,
allButtonList, artButtonList, artSpecButtonList.

Post button exported to Newsgroup mode so you can post to
  newsgroups with no available articles.

Next Newsgroup works. 

Cleaned up included articles in composition windows

Bug fixes
  - fixed sending articles/messages with editorCommand
     (always would be sent)
  - loss of keybindings after dialog pop up attributed to
    window manager problems (gwm, hpwm, and sometimes twm and mwm).
    Key bindings are not lost when using dxwm, uwm.
    [VERY STRANGE]

Organization field can be defaulted in config.h

Compose windows are now topLevelShells rather than transientShells

New XRN release (5.5):

line eater bug fix


New XRN release (5.4):

Changes from the last release of XRN:

- considerably less memory usage

  XRN uses a very simple data structure for storing information
  about newsgroups and articles.  For every newsgroup, an array
  the size of the number of articles available in that group
  is created.  This causes XRN to grow to 2.5 to 3Meg at most
  sites (at UCB, we have 650 groups and 2 week expiration, and
  XRN groups to 3Meg).  However there is no reason to keep article
  arrays for groups that you are not subscribed to. 

  Bill Webb (IBM AWD Palo Alto, ...!uunet!ibmsupt!webb) sent in a
  set of patches to have XRN only create article arrays for subscribed
  to groups.  This decreases the memory from 3Meg to 900k (for us).
  The amount you save will depend on what percentage of the newsgroups
  that you subscribe to.

- better nntp server error messages (sq)

  The messages XRN gives to the user for NNTP failures don't give
  you much information.   Ian Darwin (ian@sq.sq.com) sent in a set
  of patches to improve the error messages.

- alternative newsrcfile location (uiuc)

  Many people like to have xrn look for a newsrc file based on the
  particular server being used.  Dirk Grunwald (grunwald@flute.cs.uiuc.edu)
  sent in a set of patches to cause xrn to look for a newsrc file
  of the form <newsrcFile>-<nntpServer> before looking for just
  <newsrcFile>.

- includeSep

  A new Xdefault has been added to get rid of the "> " characters
  put in front of included messages.  Xdefault:
	
	    includeSep: on/off

  Command Line:

	    +/-includeSep

- header lines are no longer broken

  The last release included code to break long lines in news postings
  to reasonable values.  Unfortunately it would also break header
  lines (which is not allowed).  This version does not break the lines.

- updated man page

  The man page has been updated to reflect the current state of XRN.

- double click

  [note: this feature has not been added to the man page - it still
  has some problems]

  Double clicking on a newgroup entry will send you to the group.
  Double clicking on an article entry will display the article.
