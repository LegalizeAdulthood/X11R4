Rick,
    I tried your solution to my aliases problem (as I use mh here) and
it worked just fine.  Since I have my mh profile set up to use my
aliases file automatically, I didn't need to pass the shell script an
argument.  Bottom line is this in my X resources:

xrn.mailer:     /u/tengi/bin/xrn-mh-mailer

and this in /u/tengi/bin/xrn-mh-mailer:

#! /bin/csh
cat > /tmp/mail.${USER}.$$
send /tmp/mail.${USER}.$$
exit 0


Naturally, you need to be sure that /tmp/#* files geventually get
removed (we do it nightly with cron) since send renames file to #file
on completion.  Thanks for the idea.  It works great here!
