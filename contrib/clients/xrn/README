This is the X11R4 version of XRN.  This version is missing some 
functionality that the pre-R4 version of XRN had.  This functionality
will be added once I get a copy of R4 and figure out how to do it
in R4 (in particular, the ability to programmatically scroll a text
widget).


How to get XRN (other than from the MIT X11R4 distribution):

% ftp shambhala.berkeley.edu (128.32.132.54)
user: anonymous
password: guest
ftp> cd pub
ftp> binary
ftp> get xrn6-3.tar.Z
ftp> quit
% uncompress xrn6-3.tar.Z
% tar xf xrn6-3.tar


How to install XRN:

0. See the file CHANGES for a list of changes from the last release.

1. Does an NNTP server (version 1.5 or greater) exist on your network?
   - if not, get the NNTP server code and install it
     (via anonymous ftp from ucbvax.berkeley.edu)
   - make sure that XHDR (in nntp/common/conf.h) was defined
     when your NNTP server was installed.

2. Look at `config.h' and make the necessary modifications
   (default settings, location of various files, domain name, etc.)
   See ALT-MAILER for information on using a mailer other than sendmail.

3. Some versions of the X toolkit may not have MIT patch #8.  This
   patch fixed some problems with accelerators.  If you do not have
   this patch installed (you can tell, if XRN core dumps when you
   pop up a dialog you don't have the patch), define ACCELERATORBUG
   in config.h

4. Make xrn

   a. if you have an X11R3 source tree:
	  make TOP=<source-tree-top>
      1. if you are running on a macII under AUX, you will need to
	 rebuild the Makefile with imake.

   b. if no source tree, but the X libraries installed in the `right places':
	  make -f Makefile.NoXtr

	  you may need to specify values for LDFLAGS and INCLUDES
	  (see Makefile.NoXtr)

5. Copy `xrn' to your favorite binary location
   (i.e. /usr/local/bin/xrn)

6. Copy `xrn.man' to the proper man page location
   (i.e. /usr/man/manl/xrn.l)

7. Copy XRn.ad to the program place
   (i.e. /usr/X11/lib/app-defaults/XRn)

8. Check out `.Xresources' for example resource settings
