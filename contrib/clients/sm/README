This is my 3rd version of sm for version 11 of the X Window System.  I
wrote it to experiment with some of the features of the ICCCM.
There are a some things that I still want to do with it.  See the TODO
file for more info on these.
Basically this program will save and restore the state of a X session.
It does this using information provided by ICCCM conforming clients.
It assumes the window manager put the WM_STATE property on top-level
window managers, that clients put their startup command in WM_COMMAND.
(most Xt based application do this automatically), and works best with clients
that support the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF protocol.
There are many things that are not done cleanly in this program. For
some of them there is no clean way of doing them(See smpro.tbl.ms).
Some ICCCM compliant clients will not be restarted properly. 
Hopefully this program will be useful anyway.
If you have any suggestions or fixes, please send them to me at mikew@fx.com.
If you are interested in doing the window manager side of the protocol
in smpro.tbl.ms, please send me email and I will do the session manager side
of the protocol.
