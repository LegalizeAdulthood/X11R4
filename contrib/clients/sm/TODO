1. Create a better way of starting remote clients.
[If anyone has any idea or code on how to start clients on a remote machine
that is portable, please let me know. -mcw]

2. Have sm Automatically save the session at regular intervals.

3. Support clients that don't handle -geometry by setting up a window
    manager convention.
[See proposed protocol in smpro.tbl.ms. -mcw]

4. Save and restore font path, key click volumn, bell volume, etc...

5. Make sure the geometry is right(not off by border width or something).

6. Handle icon positioning.

7. Handle multiple top-level window clients
[This requires either a SM/WM communcation convention or for the client
to restore its own geometry on all windows other then a main one. -mcw]

8. Take window gravity into account.

9. Use the new alloc functions for allocating WM properties.

10. Make sure things which don't have top-level windows die properly.
[This may not be feasible. An SM, like a WM, may only be able to find out
about things with top-level windows. -mcw]

11. Support other widgets sets (Motif and Xt+)

12. Implement a clone function to allow creating another instance of
    a currently running client.

13. Implement a restart function that allows you to restart a client that
    was started by sm.

14. Implement a display state function that displays the current state.
