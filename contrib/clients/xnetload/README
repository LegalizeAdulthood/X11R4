README for xnetload
Mike Berkley, September 1989

xnetload gives the system load for a list of remote machines by using
rwhod statistics.  The load for the local machine is also displayed,
but is calculated using the standard Load widget routines, (this means
that xnetload needs to be setgid kmem.)

There's an option to turn off the local load, -nolocal, which would
allow you to run with xnetload non-setgid.  Alternatively, you can
compile xnetload with -DNOLOCAL (see the Imakefile and Makefile).

xnetload was developed on a uVax running Ultrix.  It also compiles and
runs on Sun (both SunOS 3.5 and 4), MIPS and Sequent.  Of course,
there are some little glitches: the Makefile needs to be altered and
you may need to find memcpy() somewhere.

xnetload was written mostly as a tool to learning how to use the
toolkit.  I was amazed at what the toolkit can do in not very many
lines of code.

Since this was an experiment/learning tool, I'm sure that I did not
follow all of the correct X guidelines, but I tried.

The getload() routine is just my own kludge to read rwhod stats.  It
works, but it is replaceable.  Ideally, I would like to use some kind
of system call like Sun 4's RPC versions of rwho and rup command, then
there would not be any dependency on rwhod.  If you are living on a
system that does not use rwhod, or you would like a more efficient way
of determining system load, then you can replace getload() without
breaking the rest of the program.

** Note - if you define "*Load*update", but not  **
** "xnetload*remote*update", then xnetload will  **
** set both the remote and local update times to **
** the "*Load*update" value.  If this time is    **
** much less than the rwhod update period, then  **
** the remote load displays will look more like  **
** bar graphs.                                   **
