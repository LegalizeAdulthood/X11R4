# Since xnetload finds the local machine's load using the standard Load
# widget stuff, it needs to be able to read kmem, i.e.  setgid kmem.  If
# you do not want this, then define NOLOCAL
#        DEFINES = -O -DNOLOCAL

# Dynix doesn't have -L option on load, but I have left changing the
# XLIB specification up to individual sites.  Dynix and our Sun 3.5
# don't come with a memcpy, so you'll have to add in whichever library
# has memcpy.
