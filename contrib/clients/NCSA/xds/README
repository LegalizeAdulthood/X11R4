Directory:	xds_src

This directory contains the graphics/user-interface code used by X
DataSlice.  All the code prefixed by gr_*.c here should be X-Windows
dependent, so that they may be easily changed if needed for porting 
to other machines.  The files gr_xwi*.c calls both the Athena and HP
widget sets to be used by X-Intrinsics.  These are the files that you
should look at when writing different drivers for the graphics display.
The other gr_*.c files uses regular Xlib routines.
The td*.c  non-machine-dependent code used by X DataSlice.  All the code
here should be X-Windows independent, so that they need not be changed
when porting to other machines.  The files td_hdf*.c calls the HDF routines.

If you do not wish to use the Makefile generated by the imake program,
change the filename of the file Make.noImake to Makefile and type make
after making the changes in the Makefile as indicated.
