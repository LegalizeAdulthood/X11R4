Chapter Overview



This chapter outlines the options available in the Arbitrary Planes window
which permits you to manipulate, view, and animate 2D oblique slices of
data.





Viewing Oblique Planes



Manipulating the Image

To view arbitrarily selected 2D oblique slices of data:



1.	Enable the option
Arbitrary Planes in the Attributes window (Figure 4.1). An Arbitrary
Display Mode window appears (see Figure 4.2). This window allows you to
specify an angle for the slicing plane so that NCSA X DataSlice slices 2D
planes from the 3D volume in an arbitrary fashion.

2.	Drag the Yaw
Slider beneath the Front View drawing or the Pitch Slider beneath the Left
Side View drawing to rotate the drawings horizontally or vertically,
respectively. The Front View drawing depicts the orthogonal view of the
3D volume, whereas the Left Side View shows a left side view of the
volume.



3.	Enter an integer in
the text box labeled, View Scale, to indicate the desired magnification
value. This value is used to determine the actual pixel size of the
generated image(s). Note that the speed of image generation is directly
dependent on the size of the dataset image and the view scale window.



4.	Enter an integer in
the text box labeled, No. of Frames, to specify the number of frames NCSA
X DataSlice should slice along the orthogonal axis during batch
processing (animation).



5.	Enter an integer in
the text box labeled, Percent Incr, to indicate the intervals at which you
wish NCSA X DataSlice to slice the frames (along the orthogonal axis) for
batch processing (animation sequences). For example if you were to enter
10, multiple slices, each separated by a 10% distance, would appear within
your image.



6.	Check the box
labeled, Interpolated, to specify that the generated raster image(s) be
interpolated trilinearly by the factor indicated in the View Scale text box.
If this option is not checked, the default slicing uses the floor of the data
values during fractional slicing.



7.	Click the View or
Animate button to specify that the program either generate an image for
the data slice or animate the sequence of 2D data slices, respectively.





Viewing the Image

Clicking View in the Arbitrary Display Mode window produces a generated
image of your data slice. Three options common to most image windows in
X DataSlice, Close, Palette, and Save, exist for you to manipulate your
object (Figure 4.3). For more information on these buttons, refer to
Chapter One, "Getting Started."





Animating the Image

Clicking Animate in the arbitrary display mode window opens an animation
window (see Figure 4.4). To manipulate your image using the available
options, refer to the section, "Animation Window," in Chapter Three,
"Planes Along Axes."
