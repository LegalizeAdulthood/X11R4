Installing NCSA X DataSlice



Before using NCSA X DataSlice, you must install the program somewhere
within your path on the client system (the machine on which you want to
run the application) and specify your display host (the machine from which
you wish to control and view the application). Next, define the path
environment variable to include the appropriate path, as shown below:



For example, if you were to install NCSA X DataSlice on the CRAY-2 using
C shell, you would set the path by entering a command of the form:



set path=($path /pathname)



where /pathname is the path to NCSA X DataSlice.





Specifying a Display Host

If you are running the program off a remote client machine, e.g. Cray 2, you
must first register the client machine on your X-Window host server by
typing the following on your local host:



xhost clientmachinename



where clientmachinename is the name of the remote client.





To specify your display host on your local client machine, enter a command
of the following form:



setenv DISPLAY hostname:monitornumber



where hostname is the name assigned to the desired machine, and
monitornumber is the number assigned to the monitor on which you wish to
view the program.



For example, to specify a machine named babbage as the display host and
use the first of the monitors connected to babbage as the display monitor,
you would enter:



setenv DISPLAY babbage:0





Identifying the Current Display Host

To identify the current display host, enter:



printenv $DISPLAY



The return specifies the server that is currently set as your display host.
For example, the return message



babbage:0



informs you that NCSA X DataSlice will be displayed on the machine dubbed
babbage, using monitor 0Qthe first of the monitors connected to babbage.





Invoking X DataSlice



To invoke NCSA X DataSlice, enter:



xds



The control window appears as the first frame (see Figure 1.1). It contains
the LogBook and several control buttons you will use to initiate the main
operations performed by NCSA X DataSlice:  loading a 3D scientific
dataset, loading an 8-bit raster image set, processing a scientific dataset,
and quitting the application. Thus, you may want to keep it in direct view.
You may move the window using mouse movements and operations that are
dependent on the type of window manager that you are currently running.





Figure 1.1	Control Window



 

The LogBook records and displays every non-trivial action you make while
running NCSA X DataSlice. It provides feedback such as instructions,
explanations, or warnings regarding your actions, and functions as a
notebook in which you may record your observations and comments for
future reference.



To enter text, position the pointer in the LogBook, click once, and begin to
type. Note that once you enter text into the notebook, you are unable to
delete it.



The contents of the LogBook are preserved in the file xdsLog, which should
be stored in the same directory as the application, even after you exit the
program. Consequently, you can review a session with X DataSlice by
reading the contents of the file xdsLog, and you can use vi or other text
editors to alter the contents of the file.





Loading a 3D Scientific Dataset



To load a three-dimensional scientific dataset stored in an HDF file into
NCSA X DataSlice:



1.	Click the Load 3D
SDS button in the control window. A file window appears, displaying the
current directory (see Figure 1.2).



Figure 1.2	Load SDS File
Window

 





The file window and its contents depend on the particular type of
operation you are performing. In brief, if you want to save a file, then the
Load buttons are not present, and vice versa. Only one file window may be
opened at a time, so you must close the opened window by clicking Cancel
if you decide not to use it. The file window automatically closes after
each affirmed file operation.



2.	Change the current
directory, if necessary, by entering the path to a new directory in the text
box labeled, Current Directory being displayed. Click Change to access the
new directory and its file contents. If an error message appears in the
LogBook, the current directory remains unchanged.



3.	Choose the desired
dataset to be viewed by scrolling up or down the file list window and
clicking on its filename. The name appears in the Current Filename text
box. The LogBook reports if the file is indeed a 3D SDS HDF file or a
Raster8 HDF file. If the file is of HDF format, the message shows the
number of scientific datasets contained in the file. For this tutorial,
select cloud57x57x57.hdf, which contains three 3D scientific datasets
that depict the X, Y, and Z wind velocities in a thunderstorm.



4.	Specify which
scientific dataset you wish to load into memory from the selected file by
entering a number in the text box labeled SDS #. Notice that the text box
SDS # reads 1 by default, indicating that the first SDS in the file will be
loaded unless you specify otherwise. Be aware that if you enter a value
above the designated number of datasets present, the file window closes
and an error appears in the LogBook:  ***HDF ERROR:  Cannot load SDS 4.



To load all the datasets, check the option, Load all SDSs.



NOTE:  A 3D SDS usually requires a few megabytes of memory, so although
it is possible to load up to ten SDSs together, it is not advisable to load
more that three datasets into memory at any one time.



5.	Click Cancel to
leave the box without implementing your entries or LOAD SDS to continue
with the imaging of your dataset(s). The file window disappears and an
Attributes window appears (Figure 1.3).





Windows in NCSA X DataSlice



Most windows in this program, with the exception of the Control and file
windows, have certain elements in common. When describing these
similarities, this manual will use the Attributes window (Figure 1.3) as a
representative for most other windows contained in the X DataSlice
program.



In this program you issue commands by clicking buttons in windows,
turning toggle buttons on and off, selecting within or moving scrollbars,
and entering values.



Figure 1.3	Attributes Window

 



All windows created by X DataSlice are movable under uwm or twm. Each
contains a Close, Quit, or Cancel button at the top-left corner for exiting
and disposing of the window, and features a title bar that identifies the
window according to the following convention:



filename,	#n
:	function



where filename is the name of the HDF file whose 3D scientific dataset is
represented in the window, n indicates the position of the SDS or raster
image in the file in relation to any other SDSs or raster images the file
may contain, and function is the function of the window. For example in
the Attributes window, the title bar reads, cloud 57x57x57.hdf, #1:
Attributes, which identifies an Attributes window for the first scientific
dataset in the HDF file, cloud57x57x57.



All windows other than the control and file windows are spawned in a
hierarchical format after the initial loading of a dataset. If you close a
parent window, all its children are then automatically closed by NCSA X
DataSlice, saving you the trouble of tracking which window belongs to
which dataset. Closing a window at the bottom of the hierarchy closes
only that particular window.



NOTE:  Each time you close an Attributes window, you free up a lot of
memory for additional imaging options.



Most image windows in X DataSlice offer buttons for changing palettes and
saving images named Palette and Save, respectively. Refer to the later
sections of this chapter for more information on these options.



To activate a window you are not presently in, or to bring a background
screen to the foreground, position the arrow in the desired window and
click the mouse once. Note that these actions are dependent on the window
manager that you are currently running.





Displaying Your Dataset



The Attributes Window

An attributes window (Figure 1.3) appears for each scientific dataset
successfully loaded from a specified HDF file and contains information
about that particular dataset including:  the dimensions of the dataset, the
labels and units of measurement of the respective axes, and the maximum
and minimum values of the dataset. If you have clicked the option, Load all
SDSs, an Attributes window appears for each separate dataset.



Note that when the minimum and maximum values are not specified in the
file, NCSA X DataSlice calculates them automatically. The time required
for calculation is contingent upon the size of the dataset, so several
minutes may elapse before the values are calculated. To avoid this delay,
you should pre-calculate and store the values for your dataset, using the
program "move" in the samples directory. Instructions as to how move can

be used are given in the source file move.c itself.



Besides giving information about the current SDS dataset being examined,
the Attributes window also contains a dicer scale and various display
modes from which you may choose to view your dataset.



Dicer Scale

The value you enter in the dicer scale text window determines the size of
the generated dicer image and its surrounding window. 1 is the smallest
number you may enter, and although there is no maximum limit for the
scale, 10 is the recommended upper limit. The generation time for the
image is contingent upon the dataset and the dicer scale; the larger the
dataset and scale, the longer the program takes to generate the image.
Note that you should enter the dicer scale value before choosing the
Cartesian Dicer display mode. If you fail to enter a number, the scale
defaults to 3.



Display Modes

Display modes available to the user are:  Planes Along Axes, Arbitrary
Planes, and Cartesian Dicer. Planes Along Axes, which portrays 2D slices
of data along the three major cartesian coordinate axes, also contains an
option to view 3D images generated from a V-Buffer Algorithm. The
Arbitrary Planes mode presents arbitrarily selected 2D oblique slices,
while the Cartesian Dicer displays a 2D volume slice of data as shown in
its relative location in the 3D matrix. For this tutorial, the Cartesian
Dicer mode is examined.



To generate a small image with the Cartesian Dicer:



1.	Enter a 2 in the
text box labeled, Dicer Scale.



2.	Click the diamond
toggle next to Cartesian Dicer. Notice that all of these diamond-shaped
buttons toggle on and off.



The Cartesian Dicer Display window opens.





Cartesian Dicer Display window

The Cartesian Dicer window appears as shown in Figure 1.4. The Cartesian
Dicer permits you to view 2D slices of data in their relative positions in
the 3D matrix and to manipulate their axes for the particular view you
desire. You may also designate the thickness of your slice. To choose a
thickness of one, simply click once on a particular point of the designated
slider. To choose a thickness greater than one, click on the Frame Control
Slider, and drag to the desired position. For instance, if your plane begins
at point 25 on the Y axis and ends at point 56, your dataslice will have a
thickness of 31. In both instances, the text boxes labeled Start and End
reflect the range of your dataslice. For a more detailed discussion on the
Cartesian Dicer mode, refer to Chapter 5, "Cartesian Dicer."



For this demonstration, you will manipulate the y slider to identify a data
slice with a thickness greater than one.



1.	Click and drag to a
desired point within the Frame Control Slider text box for the Y axis.
Notice the text boxes labeled Start and End reflect the beginning and
ending point of your plane, illustrating the thickness of your slice.



2.	Click the View
button. You must always click View after each slice selection. X DataSlice
now generates a new slice visible in the Cartesian Dicer window as shown
in Figure 1.5.

Working with Palettes



You can change the palette in your Dicer window, or in any window which
contains a generated dataset image (raster image) by clicking the palette
button. A file window labeled, Load a color map, opens.





Changing Palettes in One Raster Window

To change the palette in a single raster window:



1.	Change the current
directory, if necessary, by entering the path to a new directory in the text
box labeled Current Directory being displayed.



2.	Click Change to
access the new directory and its file contents. If an error message appears
in the LogBook, the current directory remains unchanged.



3.	Choose the desired
palette to be activated by scrolling up or down the file list window and
clicking its filename, in this case, carl.pal. The name appears in the
Current Filename text box (see Figure 1.6).

4.	Click LOAD
PALETTE. When you move the mouse into the raster image window, the
former palette changes to the palette you specified.



Note that many image windows contain shading bars with which you may
manipulate your palette to create a better view of your image.





Changing Palettes in Multiple Windows

When you change the palette file for a single raster window, X DataSlice
provides you the option of changing the palette in every other previously
opened raster windows. To do so, activate the Global Change toggle (in the
Load a color map file window) by clicking in its box. The designated
palette file will now be loaded into all opened raster windows. For more
information on raw palette files see Chapter 2, "File Formats in X
DataSlice."





Saving Generated Images



To save the Cartesian Dicer image along with its palette, click the Save
button located in the lower right-hand corner of the Cartesian Dicer
window. A file window, here labeled, Save a Dicer Image, appears. In the
text box, Current Filename, enter the HDF filename that will store your
Dicer image, and click the Save button to save the image; or, if you want to
append an image to the end of an existing file, simply select a filename
from the file list (see Figure 1.7), and click Save.



Exiting the Application



To exit NCSA X DataSlice, click Quit in the control window.
