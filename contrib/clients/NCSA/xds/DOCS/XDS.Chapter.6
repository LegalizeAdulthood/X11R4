Chapter Overview



This chapter explains the procedures for loading and animating a saved
8-bit Raster image and processing a scientific dataset.





Loading an 8-bit Raster Image



Loading the Raster Image

To load a saved 8-bit raster image, click the Load 8-bit Raster button
located in the control window. A file window labeled, Load a RASTER8 set,
appears on the screen (see Figure 6.1).

set File Window

 



 

1.	Select your image
in the current directory, or in another by entering the path to a new
directory in the text box labeled, Current Directory being displayed. Click
Change to access the new directory and its file contents. If an error
message appears in the LogBook, the current directory remains unchanged.



2.	Choose the desired
Raster8 file to be loaded by scrolling up or down the file list window and
clicking on its filename. The name appears in the Current Filename text
box. The LogBook reports if the file is indeed a 3D SDS HDF file or a
Raster8 HDF file. If the file is of HDF format, the message shows the
number of scientific datasets contained in the file.



3.	Specify which
scientific dataset you wish to load into memory from the selected file by
entering its number in the text box labeled SDS #. Notice that the text box
SDS # reads 1 by default, indicating that the first SDS in the file will be
loaded unless you specify otherwise. Be aware that if you enter a value
above the designated number of datasets present, the file window closes
and an error appears in the LogBook:	***HDF ERROR: 
Cannot load SDS 4.



4.	Click Cancel to
leave the box without loading your entry or Animate Raster8 to load all the
frames into memory for animation. The file window disappears and an
Animation window appears (see Figure 6.2).

Animating the Raster Image

The animation window contains an animation mechanism that may be used
to quickly display several related raster frames together to give an
illusion of motion. For more information on animating your raster image
using the animation window, refer to Chapter 3, "Planes Along Axes."







Processing Datasets



By selecting the Process a SDS from the Control window, you have the
option of expanding a small dataset by trilinear interpolation During
interpolation, each subvolume bounded by every eight adjacent data points
is assumed to contain a scalar function linearly dependent on all the eight
values, so that trilinear interpolation can be performed. The processed
datasets, once they have been saved, may be reused by NCSA X DataSlice or
any of the other NCSA visualization tools that support HDF such as NCSA
Layout and NCSA Image.



To process or interpolate a scientific dataset:



1.	Click Process a
SDS located in the Control window. A File window labeled, Process & save
a SDS (see Figure 6.3), appears on the screen.



2.	Select your image
in the current directory, or in another by entering the path to a new
directory in the text box labeled, Current Directory being displayed. Click
Change to access the new directory and its file contents. If an error
message appears in the LogBook, the current directory remains unchanged.



3.	Select the 3D HDF
scientific dataset file containing the dataset to be interpolated and input
the filename of the HDF to which the enlarged dataset is to be stored.



4.	Enter the number
of the desired SDS contained within the chosen file.



5.	Enter an integer in
the Scale box to dictate the magnification value determining the actual
pixel size of the generated image(s). The default value is 3, because 3D
datasets are generally expected to produce very small images. Remember
that the larger your dataset and bigger your scale value, the longer the
dataset will take to process.



6.	Click Cancel to
abort the File window or click Save to start the interpolation process.
Your dataset is automatically saved after the interpolation.



When NCSA X DataSlice has finished interpolating and saving the dataset,
the file window disappears from the screen and the LogBook reports on the
completed process.
