Viewing Planes of a Dataset



To view 2D slices of data in their relative positions in the 3D matrix:



1.	Enter an integer in
the text box labeled, Dicer Scale, in the Attributes window (Figure 5.1).
This value indicates indicate the desired magnification value to be used in
determining the actual pixel size of the generated image.

2.	Enable the option,
Cartesian Dicer, in the Attributes window. The Cartesian Dicer window
appears (see Figure 5.2).



3.	Click the X,Y, or Z
sliders to identify the data slice you wish to depict. The text box labeled,
Start, reflects which starting slice (an outline depicts the selected slice)
on the respective axis you have chosen. To choose a thickness greater than
one, click and drag the selected slider. When you release the mouse button,
the Start and End text boxes reflect the range of your slice. Alternatively,
you may select the X, Y, and Z toggles, and type the starting and ending
planes in the respective dialogs. Click View and the slice appears in the
image window.



4.	Click the View
button after each slice choice to generate the image. The selected slice is
represented as a color raster image within the drawing (see Figure 5.3).

5.	Repeat Steps 3 and
4 for each slice you wish to view. Figure 5.4 illustrates multiple slice
selections.

6.	Drag the contrast
slider a number of places to increase the contrast between the images. The
three sections of the palette represent the X, Z, and Y axis, respectively,
and reflect the corresponding changes in intensity. The front plane
becomes lighter and the more distant planes become darker as you drag the
palette slider to the right.



7.	Click the Palette
button to load a palette that better represents the data. A file window
appears so that you may select and load the desired palette. For
information on loading palettes, see Chapter One, "Getting Started."



8.	Click the Clear
button to clear all images from the Cartesian Dicer window.



9.	Click Save to save
the current palette in a file together with the raster images currently
depicted in the cartesian dicer window. A file window appears so that you
may save the information into a specific file and directory. For
information on saving files using NCSA X DataSlice, see Chapter One,
"Getting Started."
