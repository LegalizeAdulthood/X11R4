If you want to see more software like NCSA HDF, you need to send us a 
letter, email or US mail, telling us what you are doing with NCSA HDF. We 
need to know:  (1) What science you are working on—an abstract of your 
work would be fine; and (2) How NCSA HDF has helped you, for example, 
by increasing your productivity or allowing you to do things you could not 
do before.

We encourage you to cite the use of NCSA HDF, and any other NCSA 
software you have used, in your publications. A bibliography of your work 
would be extremely helpful.

NOTE:  This is a new kind of shareware. You share your science and 
successes with us, and we can get more resources to share more software like 
NCSA HDF with you.
