Introduction





Overview
This introduction provides an overview of the capabilities and 
purpose of NCSA X Image and directs you to sources that offer 
detailed information regarding the X Window System. The 
organization and purpose of this manual are described and 
notational conventions explained.


About NCSA X Image

NCSA X Image is a color imaging and data analysis tool based on 
the X Window System. The current release of NCSA X Image 
features:

¥	display of actual data values in spreadsheet form
¥	cartesian and polar color raster display of data images
¥	black-and-white contour and shaded data plots
¥	color palette creation and manipulation capabilities
¥	color histogram display for frequency distribution studies
¥	animation of multiple color raster images
¥	synchronized selection between corresponding image and data 
windows


System Requirements

In order to run NCSA X Image, you must have (1) a system and 
server that support color X Windows, and (2) X version 11 and 
server release 2 or later installed on your system.

NCSA X Image is written for use with window managers that 
conform to the specifications of the Inter-Client Communications 
Conventions Manual (ICCCM).

Check that you have the most current version of NCSA X Image. 
Failure to use the appropriate version of NCSA X Image for your 
window manager will most noticeably result in improper setting 
of the color maps.


Use of This Manual

This section describes the organization of this manual, and the 
conventions and nomenclature used in developing it. Although the 
instructions in this manual should enable you to successfully use 
NCSA X Image, the manual assumes that you are familiar with the 
X Window System, your local machine, and your window 
manager.

Before using NCSA X Image, you should be familiar with mouse 
devices and button-driven commands. For more information 
regarding the X Window System, refer to the guides listed at the 
end of this chapter under "Suggested Reading."


Manual Contents
This manual is organized into the following chapters:

Chapter 1, "Getting Started," introduces NCSA X Image and 
provides a brief tutorial to get you started using the program. The 
tutorial describes the basics involved in using NCSA X Image:  
installing and invoking the program, loading a dataset, 
generating images, manipulating the palette, saving a palette, and 
exiting the program.

Chapter 2, "File Formats in NCSA X Image," describes the basic 
file formats used in NCSA X Image:  raw raster, raw palette/non-
HDF, and HDF files. Information is included for obtaining HDF 
software from NCSA and the program's process of reading and 
displaying data files is outlined.

Chapter 3, "Display Options," explains the procedures for 
generating and manipulating images, generating contour and 
data plots, and creating histograms.

Chapter 4, "Palette Manipulations," describes palettes as they are 
used in NCSA X Image and explains how you may customize 
palettes for your particular image data.

Chapter 5, "Animating a Series of Raster Images"gives the 
procedures for animating multiple images.
