Chapter Overview

This chapter describes palettes as they are used in NCSA X Image  
and explains how you may tailor palettes for your particular image 
data.


Palettes in NCSA X Image

A palette is a color lookup table (CLUT) that specifies which color to 
associate with each pixel value on the screen. A palette created or 
modified in NCSA X Image consists of 256 color entries.


Palettes and the System 
CLUT
Your system hardware uses a default CLUT to display color. 
While working in NCSA X Image, you can replace the system 
CLUT with a palette better suited to your analysis and imaging 
needs.

Only a single palette may be in control of the system color table at 
any given time. When you load a new palette into NCSA X Image, 
that palette becomes associated with the palette window.

While the cursor is in the palette window or in an image window 
whose Lock Palette option is enabled, the palette associated with the 
palette window replaces the system CLUT. (The Lock Palette option 
is discussed in the following section.) This lets you observe how the 
changes you make to the palette affect your images. When the 
cursor is outside of these windows or you suspend or exit the 
application, the system CLUT returns to its default state.


Linking Images and 
Palettes
NCSA X Image allows you to link an image to whatever palette is 
associated with the palette window (i.e., the last palette loaded into 
NCSA X Image), so that while you are working within the image's 
window, the image is displayed with the desired palette. You can 
associate any image with any palette.

To link an image to the palette associated with the palette window, 
enable the Lock Palette option in that image's window.


Using the Palette Window

NCSA X Image supports three color models:  RGB, CMY, and HSV. 
Using the palette window, you can specify the value of individual 
color components from these color models, customizing the colors 
of the palette to suit your needs or preferences.

The following sections describe the color models and how you can 
use them to create and modify palettes in NCSA X Image.

Understanding the Color 
Models
The RGB color model describes a particular color as a sum of the 
three primary colors—red, green, and blue. The CMY color model 
describes a color as a sum of the complements of the primary 
colors—cyan, magenta, and yellow. These complements are 
called subtractive primary colors because they result from 
subtracting the corresponding primary colors from white light.

The HSV color model is based on the artist's concepts of tint, shade, 
and tone—here called hue, saturation, and value, respectively. 
Hue is the pure color and ranges continuously from red to 
magenta, encompassing the colors yellow, green, cyan, and blue 
in a full cycle around the spectrum. Saturation refers to the purity 
of color, and value to the brightness.

For more information about these color models, see a reference 
book such as Fundamentals of Interactive Computer Graphics by J. 
D. Foley and A. Van Dam, published by Addison-Wesley, 1982.


Creating a Palette
To create a palette using colors from a single color model or from 
several color models, click the Palette button at the Control 
window. A Palette Editing window appears (See Figure 4.1):

1.	Plot a color in the component plot by clicking on the box to the left 
of it. Figure 4.1 depicts the plots for the RGB color components 
red, green, and blue of the default palette, and identifies the 
component plot.

Click on a box that is already highlighted, to clear the plot of the 
associated component.

2.	Activate the color component whose plot you wish to change by 
clicking on the diamond to the left of it. If the box for this color 
component is not already highlighted, clicking the diamond 
highlights it automatically and plots the color component in the 
component plot. Red is the active color component in Figure 4.1.

3.	Change the values of the active color component in the 
component plot by clicking or dragging the pencil cursor within 
the color window.

An Example Palette
For example, to create a palette that has a smooth gradation from 
red to blue:

1.	Activate the red component by clicking the diamond labeled 
Red.

2.	Drag from the upper-left to the lower-right corner of the 
component plot window to modify the red component. The 
segment drawn in the component plot (see Figure 4.2) and the 
corresponding change in the palette reflect a gradual decrease 
in the value of red.

Component
                          


3.	Activate the green component by clicking the diamond labeled 
Green.

4.	Drag from the lower-left to lower-right corner of the component 
plot window to zero out the green component (see Figure 4.3).

Green Component
                          


5.	Activate the blue component by clicking the diamond labeled 
Blue.

6.	Drag from the lower-left to the upper-right corner of the 
component plot window. The segment drawn in the component 
plot (see Figure 4.4) and the corresponding change in the palette 
reflect a gradual increase in the value of blue.

Component
                          



Editing the Palette as a 
Whole
Several palette manipulations affect the palette as a whole, rather 
than individual color entries in the palette:  smoothing, fiddling, 
flipping, and rotating.


Smooth
Smoothing averages the nearest neighboring values of the active 
color component in the palette, producing a smoother palette.

To smooth the palette, click the Smooth button.



Fiddle
Fiddling compresses or expands the spectrum within the color 
palette. This allows you to alter which regions or ranges of values 
in your image are represented with the greatest detail. Moreover, 
fiddling lets you shift the center of compression or expansion.

To fiddle the palette:

1.	Click the Fiddle button. The cursor becomes a fiddle tool.

2.	Drag the fiddle tool vertically to expand or compress the 
spectrum of colors in the palette.

3.	Drag the fiddle tool horizontally to shift the palette entries in 
either direction.

4.	Click the mouse button when you are satisfied with the changes 
or wish to stop fiddling.


Flip
Flipping reverses the spectrum of colors across the center of the 
palette.

To flip the palette, click the Flip button.


Rotate
To rotate color entries within the palette, drag the cursor 
horizontally within the color bar. The palette entries rotate a 
distance and direction relative to the movement of the cursor. Note 
that when the cursor is in the color bar of the palette window, it 
becomes a rotation tool.


Editing Reserved Color 
Entries
Each system reserves color entries in palettes for the colors black 
and white to ensure that two contrasting colors will be available so 
that the system can at all times draw a visible screen and 
communicate with you.

So that you may create color tables in NCSA X Image for various 
machines, NCSA X Image allows you to edit the entire palette, 
including those entries which your machine has reserved for white 
and black. Moreover, NCSA X Image allows you to view the results 
of editing the reserved palette entries. To view your images as they 
would appear on the machine meant to use the edited palette, enable 
the Lock Palette option for the images and move the cursor into an 
image window.

To permit editing of reserved entries, click the diamond labeled 
"Don't use entire palette." This toggles the option to "Use entire 
palette." When you enable this option, the screen reverts to the 
current palette color and all windows become transparent. If you 
wish to look at a digitized image, for example, you must use the 
entire palette.
To disable the option, click the diamond again.


Undoing Changes to the 
Palette
For your convenience, NCSA X Image allows you to undo your last 
editing action or revert the palette to its initial state.

To undo your last editing action, click the Undo button.

To return the palette to its original state, click the Reset button.


Closing the Palette Window
If you wish to save your changes to the palette, you must do so before 
closing the palette window. For information regarding saving 
palettes, see the section entitled "Saving a Modified Palette," in 
Chapter 1.

To close the palette window, simply click the Done button located in 
the upper-right corner of the window.

For additional information on creating and editing custom 
palettes, refer to the documentation for NCSA PalEdit, version 1.1.
