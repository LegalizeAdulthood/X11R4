Chapter Overview

This chapter introduces NCSA X Image and provides a brief 
tutorial to get you started using the program. The tutorial describes 
the basic steps involved in using NCSA X Image:

•	installing and invoking the program
•	loading a dataset
•	generating images
•	manipulating the palette
•	saving a palette
•	exiting the program

For more detailed information regarding palette manipulations, 
imaging features, and scientific datasets, see Chapters 2, 3, and 4, 
respectively.

This chapter assumes that the X Window System (V11R3) and one 
of the window managers listed in the Introduction to this manual 
are installed and running on your display host—the server on 
which NCSA X Image will be displayed. Moreover, the chapter 
assumes that you are familiar with the particular characteristics 
of your window manager, for example, how it draws, scrolls, and 
moves windows.

For information regarding installing and executing the X 
Window System on your machine, refer to one of the guides listed 
in the Introduction to this manual, in the section entitled 
"Suggested Reading."


Installing NCSA X Image

Before using NCSA X Image, you must install the program 
somewhere within your path on the client system (the machine on 
which you want to run the application) and specify your display 
host (the machine from which you wish to control and view the 
application). Then define the path environment variable to 
include the appropriate path, as shown below:

For example, if you were to install NCSA X Image on a Unix 
machine using C shell, you would set the path by entering a 
command of the form:

set path=($path /pathname)

where /pathname is the path to NCSA X Image.


Specifying a Display Host
To specify your display host, enter a command of the following 
form:

setenv DISPLAY hostname:monitornumber

where Hostname is the name assigned to the desired machine, and 
Monitornumber is the number assigned to the monitor on which 
you wish to view the program.

For example, to specify a machine named babbage as the display 
host and use the first of the monitors connected to babbage as the 
display monitor, you would enter:

setenv DISPLAY babbage:0


Identifying the Current 
Display Host
To identify the current display host, enter:

echo $DISPLAY

The return specifies the server that is currently set as your display 
host. For example, the return

babbage:0

informs you that NCSA X Image will be displayed on the machine 
dubbed babbage, using monitor 0—the first of the monitors 
connected to babbage.


Invoking the Program

To invoke NCSA X Image, enter:

ximage

The control window shown in Figure 1.1 appears. The control 
window is comprised of four parts:  a title box, scroll bar, logbook, 
and several control buttons. The buttons initiate the main 
operations performed by NCSA X Image: loading and generating 
an image, loading and manipulating a palette, and animating a 
sequence of images. You want to keep the Control Window in 
direct view: you may move it using mouse movements allowed by 
the window manager you are currently running.

Figure 1.1	Control Window

                                           

The title box contains the name and version number of the 
application, making the control window easily identifiable. The 
logbook records and displays every non-trivial action you make. 
It provides feedback such as  instructions, explanations, or 
warnings regarding your actions. You can use the scroll bar to 
scroll through the contents of the logbook and review your session 
with NCSA X Image.

In NCSA X Image, you issue commands by clicking buttons. For 
example, you can click the control buttons in the control window to 
quit the application or access windows that allow you to load an 
image, modify the palette, or animate an image.

NOTE:  Throughout this manual, instructions to click the mouse 
button refer to the leftmost button on your mouse device, unless 
otherwise indicated.


Image and Palette Manipulations

NCSA X Image allows you to view actual data values; represent 
them as full-color cartesian and polar raster images or black-and-
white contour and shaded data plots; generate a histogram to 
provide frequency distribution information regarding a dataset; 
load and manipulate palettes to change the color mapping of your 
raster images; and perform calculations to derive new datasets.

In this tutorial, you will generate a color cartesian image and 
contour plot from the sample dataset jet2.hdf. You will also load 
and rotate a sample palette. For more detailed information 
regarding display options and palette manipulations , see Chapters 
2 and 3, respectively.

Loading a Dataset
To generate an image, you must first load a scientific dataset. For 
example, to load a sample image dataset stored in an HDF file:

1.	Click the Image button in the control window. The directory 
window shown in Figure 1.2 appears, displaying the current 
directory.

2.	Enter in the text box labeled, Directory, the path to the directory 
in which you stored the sample images provided with the NCSA 
X Image package. Click Change or press RETURN to locate the 
appropriate directory.

	You may also locate a directory by entering a root path in the 
Directory text box and allowing the system to build the path. 
Click on the desired path that appears in the Filename text box, 
and repeat until you reach the desired directory and filename.

3.	Click the filename of the sample dataset jet2.hdf. The filename 
becomes highlighted.

4.	Click Open. The directory window disappears and an image 
control window appears, showing the pathname of the dataset in 
the title box (see Figure 1.3). You can use this window to 
generate a color raster image, black-and-white plot, graph, or 
spreadsheet window representing the data array jet2.hdf.

Note that the logbook in the control window reports which file 
has been selected, notes that the file being read is an HDF file, 
and indicates that the dimensions of the image are 300x400. For 
information regarding loading a non-HDF data array (for 
which you must specify the dimensions before NCSA X Image 
can load the dataset), see the section entitled "Loading Image 
Data," in Chapter 2.

Window
                                                 

Generating a Cartesian 
Image
To generate a cartesian color raster image for the dataset jet2.hdf, 
simply click Display Cartesian in the dataset's image control 
window. The raster image is displayed in an image window (see 
Figure 1.4). To link an image to the palette associated with the 
palette window, enable the Lock Palette option in this window. 
Click Done when finished viewing image.

NOTE:  When a palette is stored with a dataset in an HDF file, 
NCSA X Image uses the first palette contained in the file to display 
the image data. When no palette is contained in the HDF file, and 
for all images stored in non-HDF files, NCSA X Image uses the X 
server default palette.


Generating a Contour Plot
Suppose you wish to depict the differing levels of magnitude that 
occur in your image data. You can do so by displaying the data as a 
contour plot, which represents a matrix of data values by drawing 
contour lines between areas of differing magnitude. Contour plots 
are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2, "Display Options."

To generate a contour plot for the cartesian image data jet2.hdf:

1.	Click the Graph button in the dataset's image control window. A 
plot window such as that shown in Figure 1.5 appears.

2.	Specify whether you wish to generate a cartesian or polar plot by 
clicking the diamond toggle button. The button label toggles 
between Plot Cartesian and Plot Polar, accordingly. For this 
example, specify Plot Cartesian.

3.	Click the Contour button. The logbook requests that you "Please 
specify contour levels to plot" and the contour specifications 
window appears (see Figure 1.6).

4.	Specify the number and spacing of contour levels and the range 
of data values to be distinguished in the appropriate text boxes. 
For this example, simply specify 10 evenly spaced contour levels 
in the text box labeled Number of Levels.

5.	Click OK. The logbook reports the number of levels you specify 
and the resultant contour plot is drawn in a new image window 
(see Figure 1.7).

NOTE:  To dispose of a window, click the Done button in its upper-
right corner. Clicking Quit or Done in a parent window will 
automatically close all its children windows.


Loading a New Palette
You may wish to change the current palette to yield the best 
perspective of your image data.

To load a palette:

1.	Click the Palette button in the control window. The logbook 
reports "Opening Palette Box" and the palette window appears 
(see Figure 1.8). 

Figure 1.8	Palette Window
                                   



2.	Click the Load button in the palette window. The directory 
window appears, displaying the current directory.

3.	Enter in the text box labeled, Directory, the directory in which 
you stored the sample palettes provided with the NCSA X Image 
package, and click Change to locate the appropriate directory.

4.	Select the filename hue.pal to load the sample palette contained 
in that file.

5.	Click Open.

At any given time, only a single palette can control the hardware 
color table on an 8 bit machine. To initialize the color table 
according to your new palette and view the palette's effects on your 
image, move the cursor into the palette window. When the cursor is 
moved outside of the palette window, the default palette regains 
control of the color table. The section entitled "Palettes in NCSA X 
Image" in Chapter 2 discusses palettes and their effects on the color 
table in greater detail.


Rotating a Palette
To rotate palette entries within the new palette, drag to the left or 
right while the cursor is in the palette bar located at the top of the 
window. The palette entries rotate a distance and direction 
relative to the movement of the cursor. Note that the cursor becomes 
a two-directional arrow tool within the palette.

More detailed information about the palette window and palette 
manipulation features is presented in Chapter 2, "Palette 
Manipulations."


Saving a Modified Palette
To save a palette you have created:

1.	Enter a unique file name for the palette in the text box next to the 
Save button in the palette window. The palette will be saved in 
the current directory, unless an absolute pathname is specified 
with the filename.

1.	Click Save. NCSA X Image saves the palette. The saved 
palette is an 8 bit palette where the first 256 bytes specify the 256 
entries of red, followed by 256 entries of green and then of blue.

Exiting NCSA X Image

If you have saved the palettes or new datasets you intend to use 
again, you may safely exit NCSA X Image without losing your 
work.

To exit NCSA X Image, click the Quit button in the control window. 
All other windows automatically close when you quit from the 
control window.
