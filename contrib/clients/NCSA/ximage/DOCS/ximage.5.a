Chapter Overview
Running an Animation


Chapter Overview
The Animate feature of NCSA X Image allows you view multiple 
frames in sequence. The jet sequence illustrates this feature by 
giving an impression of how the jet moves.

Running An Animation
To animate a series of raster images:

1.	Click Animate in the control window. The directory window 
appears, displaying the current working directory. 

2.	Enter the path to the directory in which the desired file is 
stored in the text box labeled Directory, and click Change to 
locate the appropriate directory.

3.	Select the filename of the dataset that contains the desired 
animation sequence.

	You have the option of using a wildcard to load a sequence of 
files. Simply enter the matching part of the filename, 
followed by an asterisk (*) (See Figure 5.1).

4.	Click Open. If the image dimensions are found in the file, the 
directory window disappears and a animation setup window 
appears (see Figure 5.2). Otherwise, several text boxes appear 
in the directory so that you may specify the dimensions of the 
image as described in the section of this chapter entitled, 
"Loading Image Data."

5.	Enable or disable the option animate from x server memory 
to specify how you want the animation sequence to be run. 
When animating from X server memory, NCSA X Image 
will initially read in all frames and store them in server 
memory. While this method takes more time initially, it 
usually produces a faster animation. When animating from 
disk, each frame is read off disk and displayed.

6.	Click OK. The animation window appears. You can use this 
window to initiate and control the animation (see Figure 
5.3).

To run an animation sequence using the animation window:

1.	Enter an integer in the text box labeled Skip and click the Set 
button immediately beneath it to indicate what intervals are 
to be skipped during animation. For example, if you wish to 
skip every third image as your animation is run, you would 
enter 3.

2.	Enter an integer in the text box labeled Delay (where 1 
indicates that 1/10th of a second should pass before the next 
image is shown, 10 indicates a 1 second time-lapse, and so 
forth) and click the Set button immediately beneath it to set 
this speed for the animation.

3.	Click the left or right double arrow to initiate and run the 
entire animation in either direction. Click the left or right 
single arrow to single step through the animation sequence 
in either direction.

4.	To view a particular frame, enter a frame number in the 
Frame dialog box and click on the Set button immediately 
beneath the Frame box. The bar in the box beneath the 
animation arrows moves a distance relative to the position of 
the frame in the sequence that is currently being displayed. 
You may click on the slide bar to move quickly to a particular 
frame.

5.	Enable the Repeat option to specify that the animation be 
rerun continuously.

6.	Click the button labeled <Stop> to halt an animation.


Click the button labeled Done to exit the animation window.


Enable Lock Palette to lock in the palette currently loaded into the 
palette control window.
