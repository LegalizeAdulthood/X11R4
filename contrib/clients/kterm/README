Kterm is a terminal emulator allowing to use Japanese on X11 Window System.
It is expansion of xterm and have some bugs like xterm. Further there may
be some bugs in the expanded part. If you find such bugs, send me them please.

INSTALLING

Modify Imakefile for following options.
-DKANJI		allow you to see, cut and paste Japanese texts.
-DSTATUSLINE	allow you to use a status line at the bottom of kterm.
-DKEEPALIVE	allow you to choose connection to X server with or without
		KEEPALIVE option.
-DKCLIENT	allow you to input Japanese texts with "kinput" command,
		which is a client of "jserver" Kana-Kanji converter
		program.
If none of these options is given, kterm provides same function as xterm.

Type "make install" as root.

Make sure that there is a kterm entry in your termcap or terminfo.

Install a14, r14, k14 and kana14 fonts, which are in the X11R4
distribution tape, I suppose.


CUTTING and PASTING

Kterm uses selection with COMPOUND_TEXT encoding for cutting Japanese
because any CutBuffers does not allowed to contain non-ASCII character as
defined in the ICCCM. Therefore non-ASCII text cutted this version of
kterm can not be pasted to previously released kterm (version 2.1.1 or less)
nor Nemacs, though pasting in opposite direction works well.

Encoding used in COMPOUND_TEXT is based on "Compound Text Encoding Version 1"
and G0 and G1 are used as follows:
	G0 is invoked into GL and G1 is invoked into GR, and they are fixed.
	ASCII		normaly, designated into G0.
	JIS Roman	G0 if needed.
	Latin-1 right	normaly, designated into G1.
	JIS Kana	G1 if needed.
	JIS Kanji	G1 if needed.
But for pasting, any character sets designated into any of G0 or G1 are
recognized correctly.
