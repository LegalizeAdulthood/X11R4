	This is a set of software for use of images in an X11R4
	environment.  Images can range from digitized color photographs
	to simple monochrome copies of X windows.  A matching collection
	of several hundred image files in Img format is available
	by anonymous FTP from venera.isi.edu, [~ftp/] images.

	See img_files.spec For information on the Img file format.
	This is a plain text file in this directory.


	The Img Software Set includes the following components:


	./imglib	Library of "Img" routines:  A "toolbox"
			of routines to support image-using applications.

			See ./imglib/README for additional information.

	./imgprogs	Simple programs built over imglib routines:

		descimg		Describe image file
		dispimg		Display image file
		excolors	Examine named colors
		exhibit		Exhibit an image collection
		giftoimg	Convert GIF file to Img file
		mapimg		Map or remap an image
		primg		Print window, screen, or image file
		savewin		Save window image in file
		setback		Set background to image

	./color_mapped	\	Directories corresponding to image file
	./color_rgb	 \	subdirectories on venera.isi.edu;
	./grayscale	 /	Each contains a README file and a single
	./monochrome	/	sample image.


	CAUTION:	Some operations on require LOTS of memory for
			large images.  It's possible for Various functions
			to abort with an "insufficient memory" message,
			especially when using high-resolution RGB
			(24-bit-per-pixel) images.


	-------------

	Changes in Version 1.1:

	1.  New client programs:	excolors, giftoimg, exhibit

	2.  Improved generality:  Virtually all imglib routines and
	    Img clients now handle either color-mapped or RGB images
	    with equal aplomb, if not equal speed.

	3.  Support for additional X11 visual types, with emphasis
	    on 24-bit DirectColor.  Also in this category is automatic
	    dithering for monochrome visuals.

	4.  Imglib accepts several display-related options as either
	    command line arguments or X (resource) defaults.  In
	    general these apply to all Img client programs.


	What didn't make it in time was an improved color quantization
	algorithm and matching color dithering.


	-------------


	To build the Img Software Set:

	Build procedures are consistent with X11 standards, using
	Imakefiles to direct construction of Makefiles.  If the X
	Consortium supplies a "make World" for contributed software
	in X11R4, this will build the Img Software Set.


	To build it manually, connect to the Img top-level directory
	and use imake to make the first Makefile.  This is usually
	done with a shell script invocation something like

		ximake $TOP

	After that, while connected to the same directory, run:

		make Makefiles
		make depend
		make all

	After testing,

		make install
		make install.man

	**  Caution:	Installation is heavily system-dependent,
			and often is site-dependent, especially for
			manual entries.  We recommend first checking
			a sample client program by...

		cd imgprogs/dispimg
		make -n install
		make -n install.man

	If all is well you can repeat without the -n flag; at worst
	you can redirect make's output to a file and edit it into
	a more appropriate shell script.
