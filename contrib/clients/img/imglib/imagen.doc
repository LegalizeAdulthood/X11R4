  Functions:

	This module includes a set of functions to reformat an
	image to dithered monochrome at a larger scale and print
	the image on an Imagen printer.

	These are minimally modified versions of routines from
	the old X10.4 printpix utility.  We hope to replace
	the relative crudity of most in the foreseeable future.


  Public Routines:

	print_img	Print image


  Local Routines:

	add_byte	Buffer 8 bits of data for Imagen
	write_patches	Write array of patches for Imagen
	write_imp_init  Write initialization for Imagen
	write_imp_end	Terminate output for Imagen
	dithergm	Dither grayscale to monochrome
	dither2x2	Generate 2x2 dithered output
	dither3x3	Generate 3x3 dithered output
	dither4x4	Generate 4x4 dithered output


  Module History:

	11-21-89	Paul Raveling
	Finalized version for contribution to X11R4.  Changes not
	documented in this header have been made within the last
	3 weeks.

	3-27-89		Paul Raveling
	Created module from a major part of printpix.c.  Some
	of printpix's code was adopted from a different program
	for printing rasters to Imagens.  Unfortunately I no longer
	remember what that program was.

  Invocation:

	print_img ( image, prfile, orientation, docname )


  Functions:

	Print the given image on an Imagen printer.  Convert
	color to grayscale and dither to monochrome.


  Input:

	image		Img *
			Pointer to image to print

	prfile		FILE *
			Pointer to output file; file must already
			be open and will be left open when print_img
			returns.  Callers should prefer to supply
			a pipe to lpr or an equivalent program, but
			writing to disk also works.  It just eats
			a lot of space.

	orientation	int
			Orientation code, defined in <imglib.h>:

			  PIO_DEFAULT:	    Default:  Choose best of:
			  PIO_PORTRAIT:		Portrait (unrotated)
			  PIO_LANDSCAPE:	Landscape (rotated 90-deg)

	docname		char *
			Pointer to document name (name of file containing
			image or some other string, such as "Screen Dump")


  Output:	No direct output:

		Memory is buffered into a local "patches" array, then
		written to the designated output file.
