  Functions:

	This module includes a set of image conversion functions.
	These are generally simple conversions that fall short
	of hard-core full-bore image processing.


  Public Routines:

	color_to_gray	Convert color image to gray scale
	color_to_mono	Convert color image to dithered monochrome
	dither		Reduce color content by dithering
	img_init_dither_tables
			Initialize dithering tables

			img_init_dither_tables is shared with other
			imglib modules but isn't advertised as something
			useful to imglib users.


  Local Routines:

	rgb_to_mono	Convert RGB image to dithered monochrome

  Invocation:

	color_to_gray (image)


  Functions:

	Convert colors in an image to gray scale.  Conversion
	is based on:

	    gray = .299*red + .587*green + .114*blue

	but uses the following approximation for the sake of speed:

	    gray = (77*red + 150*green + 29*blue) >> 8

	This is accurate enough to suit human perception, and
	it's adequately fast as long as the C compiler decomposes
	multiplication by constants into shifts, adds, and subtracts.

	If the image is an RGB image without a colormap, color_to_gray
	supplies a 256-entry grayscale map and sets the map index
	in all pixels.


  Input:

	image		Img *
			Pointer to image to convert


  Output:

	No direct output;  Image is modified to change colors to gray scale

  Invocation:

	status = color_to_mono (image)


  Functions:


	Convert  a color image to gray scale and dither the grayscale
	values to black and white.

	If the image is color-mapped, this replaces the color map
	with a 2-entry map.  Pixel values become 0 for black,
	1 for white.


  Input:

	image		Img *
			Pointer to image to convert


  Output:

	status		int
	<return value>	Success/failure status:
			    0 => Failure:  Image isn't color mapped,
					   or is info-only (no pixels!)
			    1 => Success
