******************************************************************************

  Invocation:

	status = quant_rgb ( image, num_colors )


  Function:


	Quantize colors for an image.  This selects a set of colors
	to represent the RGB image, defines them in a color map
	added to the image, and stores an index to entries in this color
	map in the "tag" field of each pixel.

	After calling quant_rgb, a color-mapped version of the image
	can be created by using copy_img and specifying mapped_image
	as the new image type.

	The actual number of colors in the quantized map can be
	slightly less than the number requested.


  Input:

	image		Img *
			Pointer to image to quantize

	num_colors	int
			Maximum number of colors to be retained
			in the image


  Output:

	status		int
	<return value>	Completion status:
				0 => Failed
				1 => Succeeded
