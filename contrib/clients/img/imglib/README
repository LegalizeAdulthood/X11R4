	This directory (img/imglib) contains the imglib "toolbox".
	Modules here generate imglib.a, which is used by programs
	in the Img Software Set.  All documentation on imglib
	functions is exctracted from their source and presently
	is available only as plain text files.

	imglib.ref	serves as a reference to all imglib
			routines.  Information is collated
			in alphabetic order by routine name.

	*.doc		For each module there is a .doc file
			containing the same information as in
			imglib.ref, but only for the functionally
			related routines in that module.

	Modules and the public routines they contain are:
