  Function:

	This module contains two subprograms to quantize a color-mapped
	image, so that it uses a smaller number of colors.


  Public subprograms:

	quant_cmi	Quantize color mapped image


  Private subprograms:

******************************************************************************

  Invocation:

	status = quant_cmi ( image, num_colors )


  Function:


	Quantize colors for an image.  This replaces the image's
	color map with a smaller map and midifies its pixel data
	to index the new map.

	The old color map is discarded and a new one is allocated.
	Pixel data is updated in place.

	The actual number of colors in the quantized map can be
	slightly less than the number requested.


  Input:

	image		Img *
			Pointer to image to quantize

	num_colors	int
			Maximum number of colors to be retained
			in the image


  Output:

	status		int
	<return value>	Completion status:
				0 => Failed
				1 => Succeeded
