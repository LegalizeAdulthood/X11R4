	This directory (img/monochrome) contains one sample
	monochrome image in color-mapped format.  It's a copy
	of a color image available on venera.isi.edu, converted
	to monochrome.

	After building and installing the Img Software Set,
	you can display this image with the following command:

		[cd <this directory>]
		dispimg monochrome_sample


	This image is a digitized photo from the 1982 International
	Soling Association calendar, which was not copyrighted.
	Solings are 27-foot racing sloops, the largest one-design
	class raced in the Olympic Games.  For several years I
	owned and raced one; the sort of close racing shown in this
	this calendar photo is typical because the class rules force
	all boats to be very evenly matched.

	In 1984 the U.S. had a golden (literally!) opportunity to
	watch this sort of racing in the Olympics.  However, ABC
	televised absolutely no sailing.  As San Diego's Robbie Haines
	was taking the Soling class gold medal Americans were
	dominating all other classes in Olympic sailing.  Instead
	of covering this, ABC heaped boxing on us.  As for me,
	nuts to ABC.


	Conversion of this image from color to monochrome is an
	example of using several Img Software Set facilities.
	Steps were:

	1.  Display monochrome rescaled rendition of original RGB image
	    on a 24-plane TrueColor display.  The command to do this was:

	dispimg $img/color_rgb/solings -force monochrome


	2.  Save the displayed image with:

	[cd .]
	savewin sample_monochrome


	3.  Convert from RGB image format to color-mapped:

	mapimg sample_monochrome 2  [any number works]



	Other monochrome images are available by anonymous FTP from:

		Host:		venera.isi.edu
		Directory:	[~ftp/] images/monochrome

	A copy of the corresponding README file from this directory,
	current on this date, follows.  Most of the monochrome images
	are from an old copy of Jef Poskanzer's PBM collection;
	I expect to update the img/monochrome port of these soon.
