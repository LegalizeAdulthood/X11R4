		Paul Raveling		Raveling@isi.edu


	This directory (img/color_rgb) contains one sample image
	in 24-bit RGB format.  It's a rescaled copy of an image
	available on venera.isi.edu, shrunken to limit file size.

	After building and installing the Img Software Set,
	you can display this image with the following command:

		[cd <this directory>]
		dispimg rgb_sample

	This will look great if you have a 24-bit TrueColor
	display, such as HP SRX or Turbo-SRX.  If you have
	a color-mapped display, it will be quantized down to
	many fewer colors and may look relatively awful --
	this is the most challenging image in my inventory
	of test cases for color quantization.  If you have
	a monochrome display, the image will be converted
	to dithered black-and-white.

	This particular image is a digitized photograph of a
	model.  I took this picture at a Frank's Camera Day show
	in (I think) 1978, and it was virtually identical to
	the photo that won 2nd place in the color division for
	this show.  The actual 2nd place photo was taken at the
	same time by the photographer next to me.  The image
	comes with no strings attached because the models at
	this show signed blanket model releases.


	Other RGB images are available by anonymous FTP from:

		Host:		venera.isi.edu
		Directory:	[~ftp/] images/color_rgb
