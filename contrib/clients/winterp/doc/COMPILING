BUILDING WINTERP:
================
So far, winterp has run succesfully on the following machines/OS's
	* HP9000s3xx running HPUX 7.0 or HPUX 6.5
	* HP9000s8xx running HPUX 7.0 or HPUX 3.1
	* Apollo
	* Sun 3 running the latest SunOS.
	* MIPS (Mips RS2030)

I don't think you should have any problems getting winterp running on other
machines. If you do, please tell me what you did to fix it.

Hints:
	** Motif is not free nor public domain. Contact the OSF for
	ordering info on the Motif toolkit. I will not and cannot send you
	the Motif libraries -- Motif is licensed software. Sources are
	available from OSF for $1000.00. The Motif binary distributions for
	SUNS is available from ICS. Motif is included with HPUX 7.0, which
	should be shipping now.

	** The makefiles named Makefile.hpux might be useful to those of
	you not using IMAKE. You will undoubtedly need to edit these
	Makefiles unless you are running on an s300 (68030) HPUX system.

	** By default, the program 'wl' attempts to connect to the winterp
	server through your machine's loopback adress, which it assumes is
	127.0.0.1. If that is not your loopback adress (isn't that IP adress
	standard??), then you may have to specify 'localhost' or the
	hostname of your machine. 'wl' will be able to connect to the
	winterp server more quickly if it can get an IP address without
	having to do a gethostbyname(). That's why I hardcoded the loopback
	address into wl.c... you may want to change this and recompile wl.

	** If you are compiling WINTERP on a system that provides separate
	SYSV and BSD compilation worlds, you may want to compile within the
	BSD world. winterp.c and wl.c use alot of BSD socket code that
	isn't in vanilla SYSV. Merged systems like SUNOS and HPUX have no
	problems with this. With Apollo or MIPS systems, use the BSD world.

	** MIPS bug (supposedly fixed in next OS release):

		WINTERP uses the motif file selection box widget which
		uses libPW.a to link in regex and regcmp (and getcwd).

		XtInitialize makes a call to a routine called index() which
		it is picking out of libPW.a instead of the Xlibs. This
		causes XtInitialize() to crash as soon as WINTERP comes up.

		The easiest fix for now is to remove inclusion of file
		src-server/wc_FileSB.c from linking, and then you won't
		need to include libPW.a and you won't get the wrong version
		of index(). There may be better solutions -- the above is
		the solution that worked for a MIPS user.
