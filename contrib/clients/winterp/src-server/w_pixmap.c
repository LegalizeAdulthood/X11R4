Destroying unused Pixmaps and XImage's:

Pixmaps are used by widgets to display graphical information. By keeping
track of the widget and the resource under which the pixmap is stored, we
can figure out when to free up pixmaps by using XmDestroyPixmap() to update
the reference count on pixmaps used in winterp and free the memory for
pixmaps that are no longer referenced. This is certainly useful and good to
do because I expect pixmaps to take up a reasonable amount of client and
server space, so we should be efficient about their use, especially because
motif has made it easy to do so. 

Furthermore, we don't want users manually calling XmDestroyPixmap() on a
pixmap that is still referenced -- this will cause a guaranteed coredump
due to an "X Protocol Error". 

Unfortunately, the XImage* behind the pixmap still seems to persist even if
all pixmaps based on a particular Ximage no longer exists. Since XImages
can be created inside XmGetPixmap(), or through a XmSttring-->Xm*Pixmap*
conversion it will be very hard to get a hold of the actual XImage pointer
when all we have access to are the name-strings of the previously installed
images or the filenames of new images installed. Either we'll have to
prevent creating cached XImages inside XmGetPixmap() and the
XmSttring-->Xm*Pixmap* converters, and do all this ourselves, or we can
just punt. I'm going to punt on this.

The alternative for handling XImages is to let the users that care about
space taken up by XImages to use
XmInstallImage(_XmGetImageFromFile(<image_file_name>)) at application
startup time, and then destroy the <XImage_obj> themselves when they're not
needed.  Destroying an XImage after creating the necessary pixmaps from it
shouldn't cause any protocol errors, so this is the thing to do.

Every time a Pixmap is accessed either through XmGetPixmap() or through
winterp's string-->pixmap converter (which ends up calling XmGetPixmap()),
the reference count on that pixmap is automatically increased. We want to
symetrically reduce the reference count (by calling XmDestroyPixmap()) for
each pixmap reference that is no longer used. When the reference count is
reduced to 0, the pixmap itself is freed. We do this by creating an atomic
type XLTYPE_Pixmap to store the X Pixmap pointer; every reference to this
pixmap will create a pixmap reference object which points to this
XLTYPE_Pixmap object. Code in this module will keep track of the pixmap
references made, and will remove any pixmap-ref-objs from v_savedobjs when
the pixmap is no longer referenced. If no more references to the
XLTYPE_Pixmap exist, then it will be garbage collected -- code inside the
garbage collector will call XmDestroyPixmap() on these unused pixmaps.

In each pixmap-reference object, we store
1) a pointer to an object of type LVAL_Pixmap which is returned by
   primitive xm_get_pixmap.
2) name of widget resource storing the pixmap (the winterp symbol for the res)
3) the widget-object of the pixmap.

We remove pixmap-ref-objs from v_savedobjs when
1) the widget which references the pixmap gets destroyed
2) the widget resource that references the pixmap gets set to a new value
3) the pixmap is no longer referenced within the lisp system. (see note below)

In case (1) we want to hash the pixmap into the widget's v_savedobjs
hashbucket. When the widget's destroy callback gets called, all the objects
in the hashbucket corresonding to that widget are destroyed (callbacks,
pixmaps, etc).

In case (2), since we use the scheme mentioned above in (1) to store
pixmap-objs, we can just search thru the hashbucket looking for the
pixmap-obj on the approprate widget and widget-resource symbol. If we
find a pixmap-obj, remove it from the list and replace it with the new one.

In case (3), when no pixmap-ref-objs pointing to a particular XLTYPE_Pixmap
exist, that XLTYPE_Pixmap will get garbage collected and it's pixmap will
be deallocated by calling XmDestroyPixmap(). Note that if XmGetPixmap is
called N times on a particular pixmap, we create N XLTYPE_Pixmap objects
corresponding to the N refcount on that Pixmap stored inside Motif. Each
time the XLTYPE_Pixmap gets gc'd, the refcount gets reduced inside Motif.

The only other way a pixmap can be referenced is via XmGetPixmap() or
:get_values on a pixmap resource, in which case it's XmDestroyPimap()
operation should only happen when that pixmap was no longer referenced
neither in lisp variables nor as pixmap resources. To do this, we create a
new XLTYPE_Pixmap for each reference.
