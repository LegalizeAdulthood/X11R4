/*
  We put an initializer for LVAL v_savedobjs in xlsym:xlsinit(), and add
  this to the list of structures that gets marked by gc. v_savedobjs is a
  hashtable for storing LVAL's that need to persist across garbage
  collections.

  v_savedobjs is typically used for storing callback-objects,
  timeout-objects, etc.  These objects need to persist even though they are
  not directly referenced by any user-space global variables because a
  callback or timout may occur at any time and we must not allow the code or
  lexical environment associated with one of these delayed calls to be gc'd.

  v_savedobjs is used to store LVAL's. The hash function removes the bits
  from the LVAL address used for adressing within the LVAL (i.e. rightshift
  by the # of bits in an LVAL struct. Then we take that value modulo
  VSAVEDOBJS_SIZE to come up with the index into the hashtable.

 * right shifted by the number of bits used to index inside a LVAL structure
 * Then masked by the size of the power-of-2-sized hashtable. The result is
 * a value ranging from 0 to HASH_MASK.
