.TH ppmtops 1 "01 September 1989"
.SH NAME
ppmtops - convert a portable pixmap into color Encapsulated PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmtops [-scale <x>] [<ppmfile>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Produces Encapsulated PostScript as output, using the colorimage
operator.
This operator is only defined on color printers and very recent B&W printers.
Most of the time you will NOT want to use ppmtops; instead, do a
ppmtopgm | pgmtops.
.PP
The -scale flag controls the scale of the result.  The default scale is 1,
which results in one ppm pixel producing a 3x3 square of PostScript
pixels.  On a 300 dpi printer such as the Apple LaserWriter, this makes
the output look about the same size as the input would if it was displayed
on a typical 72 dpi screen.
To get one ppm pixel per LaserWriter pixel, use "-s 0.333333".
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
.PP
Note that there is no pstoppm
tool - this transformation is one-way, because a pstoppm tool would
be a full-fledged PostScript interpreter, which is beyond the scope
of this package.
