.TH ppmrotate 1 "15 February 1989"
.SH NAME
ppmrotate - rotate a portable pixmap by some angle
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmrotate angle [ppmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Rotates it by the specified angle and produces a portable
pixmap as output.
The angle is in degrees (floating point), measured counter-clockwise.
It can be negative, but it should be between -90 and 90.
.PP
The rotation algorithm is Alan Paeth's three-shear method.
Each shear is implemented by looping over the source pixels and distributing
fractions to each of the destination pixels.
