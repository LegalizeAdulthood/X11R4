.SH NAME
ppmshear - shear a portable pixmap by some angle
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmshear angle [ppmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Shears it by the specified angle and produces a portable
pixmap as output.
The angle is in degrees (floating point), and measures this:
.PP
.nf
    +-------+  +-------+
    |       |  |\\       \\
    |  OLD  |  | \\  NEW  \\
    |       |  |an\\       \\
    +-------+  |gle+-------+
.fi
.PP
If the angle is negative, it shears the other way:
.PP
.nf
    +-------+  |-an+-------+
    |       |  |gl/       /
    |  OLD  |  |e/  NEW  /
    |       |  |/       /
    +-------+  +-------+
.fi
.PP
The angle should not get too close to 90 or -90, or the resulting
pixmap will be unreasonably wide.
.PP
The shearing is implemented by looping over the source pixels and distributing
fractions to each of the destination pixels.
