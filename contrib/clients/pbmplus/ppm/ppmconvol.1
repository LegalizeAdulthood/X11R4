.SH NAME
ppmconvol - general MxN convolution on a portable pixmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmconvol <convolutionfile> [ppmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads two portable pixmaps as input.
Convolves the second using the first,
and writes a portable pixmap as output.
.PP
Convolution means replacing each pixel with a weighted average of the
nearby pixels.  The weights and the area to average are determined by
the convolution matrix.
The unsigned numbers in the convolution file are offset by -maxval/2 to
make signed numbers, and then normalized, so the actual values in the
convolution file are only relative.
.PP
Here is a sample convolution file;
it does a simple average of the immediate neighbors, resulting
in a smoothed image:

The convolution file will usually be a bitmap or graymap instead of a pixmap,
so that the same convolution gets applied to each color component.
However, if you want to use a pixmap and do a different convolution to
different colors, you can certainly do that.
