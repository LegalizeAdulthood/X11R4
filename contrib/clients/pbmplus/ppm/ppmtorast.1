.TH ppmtorast 1 "31 March 1989"
.SH NAME
ppmtorast - convert a portable pixmap into a Sun raster file
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmtorast [-s] [-x] [ppmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Produces a Sun raster file as output.
NOTE: since it uses Sun-specific include files and libraries, ppmtorast
will compile only on Suns.
.PP
Color values in Sun raster files are eight bits wide, so ppmtorast will
automatically scale colors to have a maxval of 255.
An extra ppmcscale step is not necessary.
.PP
The -s flag forces the result to be in RT_STANDARD form; otherwise,
it defaults to RT_BYTE_ENCODED, which is smaller but, well, less standard.
.PP
The -x flag has to do with the color map.
Normally, ppmtorast attempts to rearrange or add to the colormap so
that white is in slot 0 and black is in slot 1 -- the standard Sun
default colormap.
However, if you are doing screenloads from within Xsun, on a CG2,
you want the opposite -- black in slot 0 and white in slot 1.
(Why would you be doing something this silly?  Well, I have
sometimes found it useful.)
So, the -x flag sets this.
.PP
The pbmtorast filter is significantly faster if your images are just
black and white.
