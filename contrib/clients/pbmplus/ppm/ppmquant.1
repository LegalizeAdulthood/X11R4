.TH ppmquant 1 "18 May 1989"
.SH NAME
ppmquant - quantize the colors in a portable pixmap down to a specified number
.SH SYNOPSIS
ppmquant [-floyd|-fs] <ncolors> [ppmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable pixmap as input.
Chooses <ncolors> colors to best represent the image, maps the existing colors
to the new ones, and writes a portable pixmap as output.
.PP
The quantization method is Heckbert's "median cut".
.PP
The -floyd flag adds a Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion step.
This may give better results on images where the unmodified quantization
has banding or other artifacts.
It takes maybe 20% more CPU time.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
