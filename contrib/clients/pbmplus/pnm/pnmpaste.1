.TH pnmpaste 1 "07 April 1989"
.SH NAME
pnmpaste - paste a rectangle into a portable anymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
pnmpaste frompnmfile x y [intopnmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads two portable anymaps as input.
Inserts the first anymap into the second at the specified location,
and produces a portable anymap the same size as the second as output.
If the second anymap is not specified, it is read from stdin.
The x and y can be negative, in which case they are interpreted
relative to the right and bottom of the anymap, respectively.
.PP
This tool is most useful in combination with pnmcut(1).
For instance, if you want to edit a small segment of a large
anymap, and your anymap editor is TOO STUPID to edit the
large anymap, you can cut out the segment you are interested in,
edit it, and then paste it back in.
.PP
The pbmpaste(1) tool is like this one, except that since it only has to work
with bitmaps, it implements bitblt-style logical operations.
