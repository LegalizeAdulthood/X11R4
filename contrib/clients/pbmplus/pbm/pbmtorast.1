.TH pbmtorast 1 "19 November 1988"
.SH NAME
pbmtorast - convert a portable bitmap into a Sun rasterfile
.SH SYNOPSIS
pbmtorast [-s] [pbmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable bitmap as input.
Produces a Sun rasterfile as output.
NOTE: since it uses Sun-specific include files and libraries, pbmtorast
will compile only on Suns.
.PP
The -s flag forces the result to be in RT_STANDARD form; otherwise,
it defaults to RT_BYTE_ENCODED, which is smaller but, well, less standard.
.PP
The ppmtorast filter provides the same functionality as pbmtorast, in
addition to handling color images; but pbmtorast is worth keeping, since
it is significantly faster.
