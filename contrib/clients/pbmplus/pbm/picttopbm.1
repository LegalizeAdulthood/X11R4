.SH NAME
picttopbm - convert a PICT file into a portable bitmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
picttopbm [-extraskip <n>] [pictfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a PICT file as input.
Produces a portable bitmap as output.
.PP
Note that PICT is a drawing format, not an image format, so this
program interprets a very small subset of the operators.
However, this subset includes the operators used by such programs
as SuperPaint and AppleScan when writing out bitmap images so
it's not totally useless.
.PP
The -extraskip flag is to get around a problem with some methods
of transfering files from the Mac world to the Unix world.
Most of these methods leave the Mac files alone, but a few of
them add the "finderinfo" data onto the front of the Unix file.
This means an extra 128 bytes to skip over when reading the file.
The symptom to watch for is that the resulting PBM file looks shifted
to one side.
If you get this, try -e 128, and if that still doesn't look right
try another value.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.

.SH BUGS
This should really be promoted to picttoppm, and fixed to handle PICT2.
Most of the hoocks are already in.
