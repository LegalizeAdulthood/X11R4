.SH NAME
pbmpaste - paste a rectangle into a portable bitmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
pbmpaste [-replace|-or|-and|-xor] frompbmfile x y [intopbmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads two portable bitmaps as input.
Inserts the first bitmap into the second at the specified location,
and produces a portable bitmap the same size as the second as output.
If the second bitmap is not specified, it is read from stdin.
The x and y can be negative, in which case they are interpreted
relative to the right and bottom of the bitmap, respectively.
.PP
The flags specify the operation to use when doing the paste.
The default is replace.
The other operations act as if white is 1 and black is 0.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
.PP
This tool is useful in combination with pnmcut(1).
For instance, if you want to edit a small segment of a large
bitmap, and your bitmap editor is TOO STUPID to edit the
large bitmap, you can cut out the segment you are interested in,
edit it, and then paste it back in.
.PP
Another useful companion tool is pbmmask(1).
.PP
The pnmpaste(1) tool is like this one, except that it doesn't implement
the logical operation flags -- since they don't have any useful meaning
for grayscale and color images.
