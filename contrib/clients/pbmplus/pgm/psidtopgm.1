.SH NAME
psidtopgm - convert PostScript "image" data into a portable graymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
psidtopgm <width> <height> <bits/sample> [imagedata]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads the "image" data from a PostScript file as input.
Produces a portable graymap as output.
.PP
This is a very simple and limited program, and is here only because
so many people have asked for it.
To use it you have to
.I manually
extract the readhexstring data portion from your PostScript file, and then
give the width, height, and bits/sample on the command line.
Before you attempt this, you should
.I at least
read the description of the "image" operator in the PostScript Language
Reference Manual.
.PP
It would probably not be too hard to write a script that uses this filter
to read a specific variety of PostScript image, but the variation is too
great to make a general-purpose reader.
Unless, of course, you want to write a full-fledged PostScript interpreter...
