.TH pgmtops 1 "04 March 1989"
.SH NAME
pgmtops - convert a portable graymap into Encapsulated PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
pgmtops [-rle] [-scale <x>] [<pgmfile>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable graymap as input.
Produces Encapsulated PostScript as output.
.PP
The -scale flag controls the scale of the result.  The default scale is 1,
which results in one pgm pixel producing a 3x3 square of PostScript
pixels.  On a 300 dpi printer such as the Apple LaserWriter, this makes
the output look about the same size as the input would if it was displayed
on a typical 72 dpi screen.
To get one pgm pixel per LaserWriter pixel, use "-s 0.333333".
.PP
The -rle flag specifies run-length compression.  This may save time
if the host-to-printer link is slow; but normally the printer's processing
time dominates, so -rle makes things slower.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
.PP
Note that there is no pstopgm
tool - this transformation is one-way, because a pstopgm tool would
be a full-fledged PostScript interpreter, which is beyond the scope
of this package.
However, see the psidtopgm tool.

.BUGS
One NeXT user reported that, while the EPS image did load, it also
locked up his machine.
