.TH pgmtopbm 1 "26 July 1988"
.SH NAME
pgmtopbm - convert a portable graymap into a portable bitmap
.SH SYNOPSIS
pgmtopbm [-floyd|-fs | -threshold | -dither8|-d8 |
	  -cluster3|-c3|-cluster4|-c4|-cluster8|-c8] [-value <val>] [pgmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable graymap as input.
Produces a portable bitmap as output.
The default quantization method is boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg error
diffusion (-floyd).
Also available are simple thresholding;
Bayer's ordered dither (-dither8) with a 16x16 matrix;
three different sizes of 45-degree clustered-dot dither
(-cluster3, -cluster4, -cluster8);
.PP
Floyd-Steinberg will almost always give the best looking results; however,
looking good is not always what you want.
For instance, thresholding can be used in a pipeline with the ppmconvol
tool, for tasks like edge and peak detection.
And clustered-dot dithering gives a newspaper-ish look, a useful special effect.
.PP
The -value flag alters the thresholding value for Floyd-Steinberg and
simple threshholding.
It should be a real number between 0 and 1.
Above 0.5 means darker images; below 0.5 means lighter.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
.PP
Note that there is no pbmtopgm converter, because any pgm program can
read pbm files automagically.
