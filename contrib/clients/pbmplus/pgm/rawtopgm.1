rawtopgm - convert raw grayscale bytes into a portable graymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
rawtopgm <width> <height> [imagedata]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads raw grayscale bytes as input.
Produces a portable graymap as output.
The input file is just grayscale bytes, no header and no padding.
You have to specify the width and height on the command line,
since the program obviously can't get them from the file.
