.SH NAME
pgmnorm - normalize the contrast in a portable graymap
.SH SYNOPSIS
pgmnorm [-bpercent <n> | -bvalue <n>] [-wpercent <n> | -wvalue] [pgmfile]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Reads a portable graymap as input.
Normalizes the contrast by forcing the lightest pixels to white, the
darkest pixels to black, and linearly rescaling the ones in between;
and produces a portable graymap as output.
.PP
By default, the darkest 2 percent of all pixels are mapped to black, and
the lightest 1 percent are mapped to white.
You can override these percentages by using the -bpercent and -wpercent flags,
or you can specify the exact pixel values to be mapped by using the
-bvalue and -wvalue flags.
Appropriate numbers for the flags can be gotten from the pgmhist tool.
.PP
All flags can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.
