Changes since the alt.sources distribution of 13sep89:

    Small corrections to ppmtorast, pgmtops.
    Moved pbm/tifftopbm to pgm/tifftopgm - it now handles grayscale TIFF files.
    Fixed tifftopgm to handle non-native byte order.
    Changes to tifftopgm to handle bogus AppleScan TIFF files, to have
      better command syntax, and to use stdio.
    Optimizations to xbmtopbm, pbmtoxbm, and pbmtox10bm, courtesy of
      Juha Sarlin, to make them go about three times as fast.
    Optimization to pgmtops and ppmtops to make them go three times as fast.
    Optimization to pnmcrop.
    Added PBMPLUS_BROKENPUTC defines in pbmplus.h to handle systems (such as
      ULTRIX) which have broken putc() macros.
    Rewrote ppmscale, pnmcat, and pgmhist to operate line-by-line, instead
      of reading in the whole image.
    Rewrote pnmflip to keep only one copy of the image in memory.
    Added pgmtofits, courtesy of Wilson H. Bent, plus bugfixes to fitstopgm
      and a patch to giftoppm to handle black&white GIF files.
    Added picttopbm and rawtopgm.
    Fixes to xwdtoppm and ppmtoxwd so they compile with SunOS cc as well as gcc.
    Another small change to ppmtoxwd having to do with colormap size.
    Changed macptopbm's -headersize flag to be -extraskip.
    Changed tgatoppm to read color values as BGRA instead of ARGB; the Targa
      documentation is apparently wrong about the order.
    Some changes to the Makefiles, partially to work around bugs in gnumake.
    Got g3topbm working, and added pbmtog3, courtesy of Paul Haeberli.
    Added some pixrect work-alike code so that rasttopbm, pbmtorast, rasttoppm,
      and ppmtorast can be used on non-Sun systems.  This also provides a
      final solution to the persistent byte- and bit-order problems on 386's.
    Moved the SYSV-checking #ifdefs to *after* the include of pbm.h, which
      defines SYSV.
    Made all the #else's and #endif's ANSI-compliant.
    Added manual pages for libpbm, libpgm, libppm, and libpnm, courtesy
      of Tony Hansen.
    Changed man page installation so that pages from different sections
      can go in different directories.
    Fixed Imakefiles.

Changes since the expo.lcs.mit.edu FTP distribution of 06sep89:

    Added #ifdefs to pnm/libpnm3.c to allow the PBM-PNM-only configuration.
    Small corrections to TIPS, pnm/Makefile, pnm/Imakefile, ppm/ppmrotate.1,
      ppm/ppmshear.1, ppm/ppmtoilbm.c, pbm/xwdtopbm.c, ppm/xwdtoppm.c,
      ppm/ppmtoxwd.c, ppm/ppmtoxwd.1, pbm/x11wd.h.

Changes since the comp.sources.misc distribution of 31oct88:

    Added pbmreduce, pbmlife, pbmmask, and pbmupc.
    Added gemtopbm, tifftopbm, pcxtopbm, pbmtogo, mgrtopbm, pbmtomgr,
      cmuwmtopbm, pbmtocmuwm, g3topbm, and pbmtobg.
    Minor bugfix to pbmtolj.
    Slight restructuring of most of the programs to use vastly less memory.
    Various other minor optimizations.
    Fixed pbmtorast and rasttopbm to handle byte-swapped big-endian 386 boxes.
    Slight changes to argument syntax of pbmcrop, pbmmake, pbmreduce.
    Moved to the new PGM package: pbmtops (which now produces Conforming PS).
    Moved to the new PPM package: giftopbm.
    Moved to the new PNM package: pbmcrop pbmcut pbmenlarge pbminvert.
    Consolidated into a single pnmflip tool: pbmfliplr pbmfliptb pbmtrnspos.
    Consolidated into a single pnmcat tool: pbmcatlr pbmcattb.
    Added compataliases script for upward compatability with changed tools.
    Removed xxxtopbm.
    Added a -headersize flag to macptopbm, to help get around annoying
      problems in MacPaint file format.
    Added the RAWBITS compilation-time option, to use a more compact and
      much faster (but less portable) external format.
    Removed the CBM format - use compress(1) and / or RAWBITS instead.
    Pbmpaste (and the new pnmpaste) now accepts negative x and y coords,
      which are interpreted relative to the right and bottom sides.
    Changed all programs to accept a "-" file argument as meaning standard
      input.
    Removed pbmtox10wd, since it was never very useful (X10 doesn't have xwud).
    Added Imakefiles, for X11 types to use.

Changes since the X.V11R3 distribution of 31aug88:

    The cbm format has been revised to support run-length encoding.
    Pbmtops now does run-length encoding.

Major changes since the X.V11R2 distribution of 28mar88:

    The pbm format now has a "magic number".
    New conversion filters: brushtopbm, giftopbm, pbmtolj, pbmtomacp,
      pbmtoxwd, and pbmtox10wd.
    Icontopbm converter has a better parser -- it knows to skip over
      any extraneous comments at the beginning of the icon file.
    Pbmtops generates a different PostScript wrapper program -- it should
      handle huge bitmaps better.
    Xwdtopbm now handles byte-swapping correctly.
    Pbmmake takes a flag to specify the color of the new bitmap.
    Pbmpaste now implements 'or', 'and', and 'xor' operations as well
      as the default 'replace'.
