The olgx (OpenLook Graphics for X11) library is currently used by olwm
(OpenLook Window Manager) and will be used by the XView library in
a future release.  Olgx is an X11 drawing engine for 2-D and 3-D objects
which is based upon xlib rather than a toolkit.  This needs to be built before
olwm can be built.

When building the library, be sure to change the Imakefile to correctly
represent where things should go when installing.  By default, they are
set up to install things in place on the contrib tape.  See Imakefile for
details.

Since olwm is the only application at this time that uses olgx, it does
not have the shared library building facility in the Imakefile.

Although the content of the library may change in the future, the
API (Application Programmer's Interface) should remain stable.

Two documents describing olgx reside in the doc directory in PostScript 
format.  Each document is one file.  The olgx_api.ps describes the 
current API.  The olgx_paper.ps describes some ideas behind the library.
