! xmodmap 8-bit key re-binding file for USASCII.  Uses default keysym map.
! At least one xmodmap file must exist for consoleterm to operate.
! If any key bindings are placed here, this file must be different
! for the different machines, as it is read with both the VT200
! and the 4315/16/19 keyboards.

! force processing of keycode map before use in compose sequences.

! 3-key acute, degree, asciitilde, diaeresis, macron : apply to those kbds 
! that have them.  Because Danish and German have
! both apostrophe and acute (ISO Latin-1 diacritical), make both function 
! with 3-key compose.  Only acute works with 2-key compose.
