          encoding mapping from the system's locale character set to X font
          indexes. Its goals  are  to  :  Support  mapping  from  single  &
          multibyte character strings to a fonts code set.  Provide mapping
          from a single character set to multiple  fonts.  MultibyteX  will
          incorporate  the  concept  of character set (CS) identifiers with
          each  identifier  being  associated  with  a  font.  No   further
          knowledge  of CS is defined by MultibyteX.  Support XLFD standard
          CHARSET_ENCODING that are registered.   (not  in  first  release)
          Conform to existing multibyte functions found in ANSI-C.
          MultibyteX  will  use  the  LC_CTYPE  catagory   (used   by   the
          setlocale())  to affect the behavior of the MultibyteX functions.
          For any given codepoint within a LC_CTYPE locale  the  MultibyteX
          functions  will  identify  the  character set identifier and font
          index.   The  character  set  identifier  will  be  mapped  to  a
          paritcular  font  file under X.  The number of CS identifiers and
          association to font code set is locale specific.  There shall  be
          no  limit  placed  on  the  number  of  character set identifiers
          supported by a particular locale ( As in the case of  the  Taiwan
          SEED  project  they  are  defining 16 planes of double octet code
          points.) &Chset. identifiers will be simply numbered seqencially,
          CS0/CS1/CS2/..., with CS0 always being assumed to be ASCII.
          The following is the Release plan for the code: Version 1.1
          The current version, 1.1, is  a  protype  version  that  has  its
          encoding tables linked in with the program and has some setlocale
          stub code included for systems that don't have it.  Version 2.1
          Externalize the encoding tables  under  some  NLS  directory.   I
          suggest /usr/lib/X11/nls/$LC_CTYPE.mbX.  Version 2.2
          Perform XLFD validation of encoding  information  in  the  fonts.
          Plus more convience functions, eg. mbXDrawLineUndeline.  p.
          The following define the interfaces  provided.   In  general  all
          MultibyteX  functions perform similiar to the Xlib function it is
          dependent on.  Refer to Xlib Reference manual for list of Errors.
