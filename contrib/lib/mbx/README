This directory contains all the code associated with the Multibyte X
proposal.  The following explains how to build and run the mbtest.

1) If your system does not support setlocale do the following:

   mkdir locale
   cp locale.h locale

2) Build mbtest - built for the "a1 k14 kana14" font set.

   make mbtest DEFINES='-DAIX -DKANA_GL' LOCALE_INC=-Ilocale LOCALE=locale.o
   or
   make mbtest

3) Run mbtest in ASCII locale

   mbtest fixed < mbX.h
   ( Press any key to have it start scrolling - no back scrolling) 

4) Run mbtest in SJIS locale

   setenv LANG Jp_JP.pc932
   mbtest "a1 k14 kana14"

   ( Press any key to have it start scrolling - no back scrolling) 
   ( Test will generate its own data - 7 columns of CS0 CS1 CS2 CS3 CS2 CS1 CS0)


Special Notes:

  The mbXsj.c will build the translation table to for from sjis to 
  font index.  The indexes are based on the JISX0201 and JISX0208
  definition.  The kana set is assumed to the the GR.  There is an
  option KANA_GL to have it build the table to the GL set.
